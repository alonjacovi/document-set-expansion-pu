{"title": "Energy-dependent exchange of adenine nucleotides on chloroplast coupling factor (CF1).", "abstract": "1. [14C]ADP is incorporated into washed broken chloroplasts in the light. The bound labelled nucleotides which cannot be removed by washing are almost exclusively related to coupling factor CF1. [14C]ADP binding exhibits a monophasic concentration curve with a Km of 2 micronM. 2. By illumination of the chloroplasts, previously incorporated labelled nucleotides are released. A fast release is obtained in the presence of unlabelled ADP and ATP, indicating an energy-dependent exchange. A slow and incomplete release is induced by light in the absence of unlabelled adenine nucleotides. Obviously, under those conditions, an adenine nucleotide depleted CF1 conformation is established. 3. Re-binding of [14C]ADP by depleted membranes is an energy-independent process. Even after solubilization of adenylate-depleted CF1, [14C]ADP is incorporated into the protein. By re-binding of ADP in the dark, CF1 is converted to a non-exchangeable form. 4. Energy-dependent adenine nucleotide exchange on CF1 is suggested to include three different conformational states of the enzyme: (1) a stable, non-exchangeable form which contains firmly bound nucleotides, is converted to (2), an unstable form containing loosely bound adenine nucleotides. This conformation allows adenylate exchange; it is in equilibrium with (3) a metastable, adenylate-depleted form. The transition from state (1) to state (2) is the energy-requiring step.", "pmid": "856262", "mesh_set": "D000244 D000249 D000255 D002259 D002462 D002736 D003624 D004579 D004734 D007700 D008027 D010086 D010940 D010944", "score": 16.160294, "rank": 4010, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

After 20 weeks, a reduction (appr. 25%) was found in the number of nerve cells and oligodendrocytes. The total number of glial cells, however, was unchanged during the experiment; this demonstrates the need of performing differential counts when evaluating gliosis. Probably, a part of the increase in the number of astrocytes was due to a transformation from precursor cells, usually classified as oligodendrocytes. The increased number and size of astrocyte nuclei are probably connected with an enhanced astrocyte metabolic capacity due to alterations in the ammonia and amino acid metabolism.", "pmid": "835349", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001253 D001923 D002252 D002452 D002467 D056486 D003342 D006501 D008099 D008106 D008297 D009185 D009457 D009474 D009836 D051381 D013997", "score": 17.208698, "rank": 3451, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Nitrogen metabolism, tissue carnosine concentration and blood chemistry of gravid swine fed graded levels of histidine.", "abstract": "Three nitrogen metabolism experiments were conducted to determine the qualitative and quantitative histidine need of first-litter gilts during the last third of pregnancy. A completely purified, crystalline 8amino acid diet was formulated to meet all nutrient needs of the gravid gilt when 2 kg/day was fed. Experiments 1 and 2 were 9-day nitrogen balance studies, each consisting of three littermate gilts subjected to three levels of dietary L-histidine in a Latin square arrangement of treatments. Nitrogen retention was depresed, but not significantly, when less than 0.12% histidine was fed. Complete deletion of histidine, however, did not depress retention below that observed when 0.06% was fed. This suggested that either histidine biosynthesis or its release from endogenous reserves was confounding retention data. Therefore in a third experiment, two gilts were fed a histidine-free diet for 24 days in an attempt to deplete endogenous reserves. For comparison, two siblings were fed 0.12% histidine during this same period. Nitrogen retention tended to be lower for gilts fed the histidine-free diet during each of three consecutive collection periods. Blood hemoglobin, muscle and olfactory bulb carnosine concentration, plasma protein and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity, and blood urea nitrogen were all unaffected by treatment. Offspring from gilts fed the histidine-free diet had lower blood hemoglobin concentrations than their counterparts from gilts receiving histidine.

The third series of experiments showed that feeding of rats with small doses of aminoacids for a long time leads to regular shifts in distribution of both the aminoacids and the monoamines. The aminoacids increasing the brain activity were found to activate the production of cycle-adenyl acid. Those aminoacids which inhibit the brain activity, decrease the production of cyclic-AMP. Tranquilizers which decrease the level of monoamines and inhibit the brain activity, also decrease the production of cyclic-AMP. Antidepressants inhibiting MAO and increasing the level of monoamines in the brain, activate the production of cyclic-AMP.

The level of cAMP in the tumour is 3 times lower than that in liver. By te kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km, pH optimum) adenylate cyclase from tumour does not show any significant differences as compared to the liver enzyme; the enzyme from hepatoma is, however, more sensitive to activation by F- ions. The activities of adenylate cyclase in liver and tumour cells are the same. Phosphodiesterases of cAMP from tumour and liver cells are similar in their Km values (3,3-10(-4) M for PDE1 and 2-10(-6) M for PDE2); however, the maximal and real rates of cAMP hydrolysis in hepatoma are much higher than in liver. The fact that both cAMP phosphodiesterase activities have similar dependence on Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations, suggests that PDE1 is a latent form of PDE2. In tumour cells the equilibrium between these two forms is probably shifted towards the enzyme with high affinity for the substrate.

Only quiet sleep was evaluated due to its longer duration after the second month of life and its important developmental characteristics. The criteria of abnormality were the following: lack of bioelectric features of sleep, abnormal \" trac \u00e9 alternant \", and other criteria of defined range, character and morphology. The number of abnormal records was referred to the three periods of the first year of life: first and second trimester, and the second semester of the first year of life, and also to treatment. EEGs before treatment were considered as records of untreated children. Table 1 compares the number of normal and abnormal records according to age and treatment. Table 2 illustrates the character and the range of abnormalities with reference to age and treatment. Tables 3, 4, 5, give the characteristics of morphological features of abnormal records. Our previous papers describe EEGs of PKU children of different age during waking and sleeping, while the present study is the evaluation of EEGs in children of the same age recorded in sleep only. The choice of these criteria is justified by the greatest variability of EEG records in relation to developmental factors and activating role of sleep. Among all EEGs, 60% were recorded during treatment. The biggest number of EEGs recorded in untreated children was obtained in the first three months of life and became gradually less.

The histology and the fine structure of several segments of the epididymis, the ventral prostate, and the seminal vesicle were studied at intervals after treatment for up to 16 weeks. The epididymides of treated animals weighed less than those of control rats. Microscopic alterations in the epididymis were similar in rats treated with Provera alone and in those animals that received Provera and testosterone, but the changes varied with the segment of the epididymis. In the middle segment in the caput epididymidis, the normally abundant luminal sperm were absent but the epithelium retained its normal ultrastructural features. In the terminal segment in the cauda epididymidis, different changes were observed in the proximal and distal portions. In the proximal cauda epididymidis, the lumen was small, irregular in outline, and virtually devoid of sperm. The light cells of the epididymal epithelium in the proximal cauda contained extremely large numbers of dense bodies resembling lysosomes, which occupied most of the supranuclear and basal cytoplasm. In contrast, in the distal part of the cauda epididymidis, the epithelium had a normal appearance but the lumen was filled with debris, sperm, and spherical masses of cytoplasm that were apparently derived from germ cells. It is suggested that the clearing of the lumen of the proximal cauda epididymidis may reflect the greater activity of light cells of the epididymal epithelium in that region. Although alterations in spermatogenesis may be most important in the antifertility effect of progestin and androgen, these alterations in epididymal sperm and epithelium may also play a role. The weights of the prostate and seminal vesicles of rats treated with Provera (1 mg/100 g/day) were greatly reduced compared to those of control rats. Although there was considerable variation, in many specimens treated with Provera alone the epithelium of the prostate showed a change from a columnar to a cuboidal or squamous shape, and there was a reduction in the size and abundance of organelles involved in the formation of secretions. The microscopic structure of the seminal vesicle of rats treated with Provera was less severely affected than the prostate. Although the seminal vesicle epithelium of Provera-treated rats was generally not as tall as in control animals, the cells possessed parallel cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vacuoles, and an active-appearing Golgi apparatus, suggesting that they continued to be able to form secretions in the presence of Provera. The weights of the sex accessory glands were maintained at control levels by the administration of testosterone, 100 mug/100 g/day, along with the Provera.

Rate studies of N-oxidation of aniline and N,N-dimethylaniline by rabbit liver microsomal preparations were performed at different pH values. The apparent pKs of the free functional groups were 7-2 and 6-9, respectively, at 26 degrees. The apparent heats of ionization of these groups varied from 26-8 to 31-8 kJ mol-1. 2. Photo-oxidation of the microsomal mixed function oxidase resulted in rapid loss of N-oxygenating activity. The enzyme was markedly protected from inactivation by the presence of aniline or N,N-dimethylaniline. The apparent KD values for protection were close to the Km and KS values for the individual arylamines. The pH profiles of the initial rates of photo-inactivation resembled the titration curves of groups with an apparent pKa between 6-0 and 6-2. 3. The N-oxidase was strongly inhibited by diethyl pyrocarbonate at pH 6-2. 3. The N-oxidase was strongly inhibited by diethyl pyrocarbonate at pH 6-0. Catalytic capacity was partially restored by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine. Pyridine protected the enzyme from acylation. 4.

We have examined and compared the ability of binocularly activated striate neurons to make both position disparity and orientation disparity discrimination in the anesthetized (N2O/O2) and paralyzed cat preparation. 2. Accurate knowledge of eye position is essential for disparity studies. Using a retinal projection technique able to detect eye drifts of less than 3' arc per retinal landmark and less than 18' arc cyclorotation disparity, we determined eye drift during the course of 2- to 4-day experiments. After the initial eye rotation due to the anesthesia and the onset of paralysis (see below), rotational drift thereafter was mainly excyclorotatory and, from all causes, rarely totaled more than 4 degrees disparity. All our data have been corrected for this residual cyclorotatory drift. 3. Optimal stimulus orientation disparities were determined from quantitative monocular orientation tuning curves for 74 binocularly activated striate cells (37 simple, 3 hypercomplex I, 31 complex, 3 hypercomplex II) from nine cats. Without exception, the mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity in each of our animals showed a departure from zero disparity equivalent to an incyclorotation of the eyes (mean, 9.2 degrees; range, 2.7 degrees-15.9 degrees). 4. We attribute this mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity shift to ocular cyclorotation as a result of the initial anesthesia and paralysis. Assuming equal intortion, incyclorotation for each eye averages 4.6 degrees. On the assumption that the mean optimal stimulus orientation disparity is zero in normal life, we pooled results from the nine animals about their individual means. For the 74 cells the resulting distribution of the optimal stimulus orientation disparities had a range of about +/-15 degrees (simple cells: SD 4.9 degrees; complex cells: SD 7.4 degrees). 5. We examined the relationship of the sharpness of the orientation tuning curves to ocular dominance, to absolute orientation preference, and to other unit properties. The striking observation was the high correlation between the sharpness of orientation tuning curves for the two eyes of a binocular neuron. For simple cells the mean difference for the half-widths of half-height was only 2.54 degrees, with sharpness showing a high correlation between the two eyes (r=0.915) over half-width at half-heights ranging from 8.5 degrees to 41.8 degrees. Complex cells showed a similar, albeit weaker, correlation. 6. Having shown that, assessed monocularly binocular units show different orientation tunings in the two eyes, we undertook binocular experiments to ascertain if these differences were the optimal disparities of sharply tuned stimulus orientation disparity channels.

By multiple stepwise regression analysis, the combination of parameters which most effectively determines gastric emptying rate was found to be: concentration of the organic anion, followed by intragastric volume and number of previous test meals given on the same day. These three parameters appear in the equation for gastric emptying rate in which the individual characteristic of each acid is expressed by a constant. 4. Among the various acids, inhibition of emptying rate increases with rising number of carboxylic groups of the acid and its molecular weight. 5.

{"title": "Major membrane protein differences in cilia and flagella: evidence for a membrane-associated tubulin.", "abstract": "The membrane of both sperm flagella and gill cilia of the scallop Aequipecten irradians may be selectively solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 30 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl), pH8, and 3 mM MgCl2, leaving the axoneme totally intact. This membrane fraction represents about 20% of the total protein of the respective organelle. Analysis of the flagellar membrane by sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO4)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed one principal protein component, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive and migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 250,000. The remaining minor proteins, none of them PAS positive, accounted for less than one-third of the total flagellar membrane fraction. Analysis of the ciliary membrane also revealed one major protein component, weakly PAS positive and migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000. The remaining minor proteins represented about one-third of the total ciliary membrane fraction; two components with molecular weights of 100,000 and 40,000 predominated. The latter could be substantially reduced by purification of the cilia on a sucrose density gradient and was assumed to be actin, derived by vesiculation of the brush border during deciliation. The principal ciliary membrane protein, that of 55,000 daltons, was resolved into two equimolar components on NaDodSO4-Tris-glycine-polyacrylamide gels, comigrating with the alpha and beta chains of outer fiber tubulin. S-carboxymethylation caused increased splitting of the two components and concomitant migration with similarly treated ciliary tubulin. Preparative gel electrophoresis yielded separate components whose cyanogen bromide cleavage products were virtually identical in size distribution with those obtained from outer fiber alpha and beta chains; tryptic peptides corresponded almost exactly to those of authentic tubulin subunits but certain positional differences indicated possible side chain modification. At 25 degrees C both whole cilia and its solubilized membrane fraction bound colchicine while whole flagella and the 9 + 2 axoneme from either organelle did not. Thus certain molluscan flagellar membranes primarily contain a 250,000-dalton glycoprotein but ciliary membranes have a modified tubulin as the major protein component. At an electron microscopic level, flagellar membranes have a distinct trilamellar \"unit membrane\" structure while ciliary membranes appear thinner and considerably less distinct, perhaps reflecting the protein compositional differences in the membranes of these other wise morpholobically identical organelles.", "pmid": "861196", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002923 D003078 D003429 D005407 D005880 D006023 D008297 D008565 D008566 D008854 D008970 D008974 D010446 D013094 D014404", "score": 8.99091, "rank": 6107, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Subcutaneous and intraduodenal injections produced a dose-related inhibition in both total acid and volume of gastric secretion. Dose-response curves for inhibition obtained by these routes were parallel, although PGE1 was more potent when given subcutaneously. Gastric administration produced a dose-related decrease in acid and an increase in volume. The slope of the dose-response curve for acid inhibition with this route was flatter than with subcutaneous or intraduodenal administrations. The present results suggest that PGE1 inhibits gastric secretion by the same mechanism of action when given subcutaneously or into the duodenum, while the effects observed after gastric administration are consequences of local actions.

In contrast, 35S-phenol red (0.001 mM) accumulated in lung slices to a much greater extent than did DSCG, and the measured tissue spaces continued to increase over a 3-hour incubation period. In the presence of either phenol red (1 mM) or the metabolic inhibitors, iodoacetic acid (10(-4) M) and dinitrophenol (10(-4) M), 3H-DSCG uptake was significantly decreased. Accumulation of 3H-DSCG in lung slices and binding to tissue homogenates (pH 7.4) was also decreased when Ca and Mg ions were omitted from the bathing solution. Although DSCG and phenol red mutually inhibited the accumulation of one another over time in lung slices and 3H-DSCG (0.001 mM) binding to lung homogenates was decreased in the presence of 1 mM phenol red, 35S-phenol red efflux was not altered by the addition of 1 mM DSCG during the washout.

Therefore, it is important to avoid these problems for improving the patient's QOL. Rikkunshito extract (RK) possesses antiemetic effects and is used in combination in cancer therapy. However, patients with cancer find it difficult to take the medicine orally for the treatment of NV and anorexia owing to the characteristic smell and taste of traditional Chinese medicine. We examined the pharmaceutical properties of RK suppository for hospital use, assessed bioequivalence by using pharmacokinetic parameters, and determined its effectiveness against NV and anorexia in rats. In this study, RK suppository was prepared by using RK formulation (A, B, and C) and Witepsol (H and S) (AH, BH, CH, AS, BS, and CS). Pharmaceutical properties, namely, hardness, dispersibility, long-term stability, and drug (hesperidin and glycyrrhizic acid) release were measured for AH, BH, AH, and AS. The pharmacokinetic parameters, effectiveness of substance P against NV and anorexia, and serotonin-activated ghrelin levels were assessed for BH only. AH, BH, AS, and AS demonstrated uniform and sufficient hardness. The release rate of oleaginous components, such as glycyrrhizic acid, did not change significantly, while that of water soluble components, such as hesperidin, decreased when compared with that in powder formulations A and B. NV and anorexia improved in rats administered BH compared with the control group.

{"title": "Renin and aldosterone secretion in pheochromocytoma. Effect of chronic alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade.", "abstract": "Patients suffering from pheochromocytoma characterized by an exclusive or almost exclusive excess of norepinephrine showed no (one patient) or only a moderate increase (two patients) in renin and aldosterone secretion. In those three patients with concomitant distinct hypersecretion of epinephrine, renin release (and aldosterone secretion except in one patient) was markedly enhanced. Similar results were obtained in a patient with excess norepinephrine and dopamine secretion. Renin release was markedly reduced in all patients during preoperative long-term alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade. With the exception of one patient, increased renin and aldosterone secretion was abolished. The results indicate that augmentation in renin release depends on the ratio of the different catecholamines secreted by the pheochromocytoma and their different effe-tiveness in stimulating beta-adrenergic receptors. Even in the presence of excess catecholamine secretion, there is evidence that renin secretion is predominantly mediated by beta receptors rather than by renal vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors. Normalization of catecholamine-induced enhanced renin release in patients with pheochromocytoma during chronic alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade supports the assumption that (alpha-) adrenergic blocking agents inhibit renin secretion distal to their blockade of specific adrenergic receptors. However, contrary to beta-adrenergic blockade, circadian rhythm of renin release seems to remain intact during alpha-adrenergic blockade.", "pmid": "14500", "mesh_set": "D000293 D000317 D000328 D000450 D001794 D002648 D002940 D004298 D004837 D005260 D006801 D008297 D008875 D009638 D010643 D010673 D011942 D011943 D012083", "score": 19.292458, "rank": 2514, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The tissue contains a single isozyme of adenylate kinase, the enzyme from cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments (90 and 10% of total activity, respectively) being identical in physical and kinetic properties. Molecular weight was found to be 27,000 +/- 400. The enzyme shows a pH optimum of 8.2 in the forward (APD utilizing) and 7.4 in the reverse direction. Michaelis constants for ADP, ATP, and AMP are 0.70, 0.13, and 0.15 mM, respectively, with optimal Mg2+:adenylate ratios being 1:2 for ADP and 1:1 for ATP. A comparison of mass action ratios with the equilibrium constant indicated that squid adenylate kinase is held out of equilibrium in resting, but not active, muscle. A search for metabolic modulators of adenylate kinase revealed that NADH (Ki of 0.1 mM) was the only modulator which exerted a significant effect within its in vivo concentration range. The data presented indicate that NADH inhibition is the factor maintaining adenylate kinase in a nonequilibrium state in resting muscle and that release of this inhibition can serve to integrate adenylate kinase into the known scheme of intermediary metabolism in this tissue. A sharp drop in NADH levels at the onset on muscular work co-ordinates that activation of aerobic metabolism in this tissue and allows adenylate kinase to return to equilibrium function. At equilibrium, the enzyme can function to ampligy the concentration of AMP, a potent activator and deinhibitor of key glycolytic and Krebs cycle enzymes. The effect of modulators of adenylate kinase in preventing denaturation by heat or proteolysis revealed that NADH and substrates induced conformational changes in the enzyme which rendered it less susceptible to denaturation.

Glucose, fructose and galactose were found to be the most stimulative. Glycerol and glucono-delta-lactone were less stimulative; next in order were n-propanol, n-butanol, glycols and butanediols, which were likewise effective; acetate, lactate and pyruvate were slightly stimulative. In contrast, ribose, xylose, arabinose, ribitol, citrate, succinate, oxaloacetate, glyoxylate and malate were rather inhibitory, in additions at 1.0%. Among these compounds, ethanol (1%) greatly stimulated  riboflavin formation. Maximum flavinogenesis with the above stimulants was attained by the additions of 1% ethanol, 1.25--3.0% glucose, 1.25% glycerol, 4.0--6.0% propane and butanediols, 1.0% pyruvate and 0.9% acetate after 37 hr incubation, respectively.

After desalting, preliminary fractionation (plasma only), and concentration, the preparations were focused in a pH 3--10 gradient on 20-cm glass plates layered with Sephadex slurry. The pH 4--6 region, containing all the substrate, was scraped from this plate and refocused in a pH 4--6 gradient. Substrate content of 1-cm strips of slurry from half of the plate was determined by both radioimmunoassay and bioassay of angiotensin resulting from incubation with added renin. Corresponding strips from the other half of the plate were incubated without renin as a control for any preformed angiotensin. The asymmetry and broad distribution (pH 4--5) of substrate from different sources suggested the existence of more than one form. Higher resolution achieved by using the high substrate concentration of postnephrectomy plasma and 0.5-cm strips of slurry on 20-cm or 40-cm plates revealed peaks and shoulders of substrate activity.

In order to obtain membranes of varying fluidity, rats were fed diets that were either fat-free or supplemented with 15% safflower oil, and two properties associated with aorta and liver microsomal membranes were selected for study: stearyl CoA desaturase activity, and fluidity as monitored by fatty acid composition and microviscosity (measured by fluorescence depolarization). If fluidity directly modulates desaturase activity, one would predict that a low fluidity would stimulate the desaturase activity. Ten times more desaturase activity is present in aorta microsomes from rats on a fat-free diet than in microsomes from rats on a safflower oil supplemented diet. However, on the fat-free diet, these aorta microsomes were more fluid than those of rats fed safflower oil supplemented diet. The fluidity of liver microsomal membranes was not altered in response to diet, despite significant changes in desaturase enzyme content. The contrasting evidence presented here suggests that no correlation exists between desaturase enzyme activity and membrane fluidity in the two tissues studies.

Using histone type IIA as substrate, feedback regulator was inhibitory at low histone concentrations and stimulatory at high concentrations. Preincubation of protein kinase with feedback regulator resulted in inhibition at all histone concentrations. With some protein substrates, e.g. histone f2b and casein, inhibition was observed at all histone concentrations. 3. The stimulation of histone type IIA phosphorylation resulted from an increased V with no effect on either the apparent Ka for cyclic AMP or the Km for ATP. Time course studies suggest that feedback regulator increased the rate of phosphorylation without increasing the total number of phosphorylation sites. Increased histone phosphorylation was observed regardless of whether the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was peak I or peak II (off Deae-cellulose), isolated from bovine or rabbit skeletal muscle or rat heart. A small stimulation was observed using cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase. 4. These results indicate that feedback regulator can inhibit or stimulate protein kinase, an effect which is probably substrate directed, and depends on the reaction conditions. Whether feedback regulator modulated protein phosphorylation in vivo in addition to its inhibition of adenylate cyclase is unknown. However, stimulation of protein kinase activity in the presence of cyclic AMP is a valuable and rapid assay for monitoring feedback regulator fractions during purification procedures.", "pmid": "15626", "mesh_set": "D000273 D000818 D002110 D000242 D004355 D004789 D004837 D005246 D006863 D007700 D006656 D011494 D011506 D051381 D013696", "score": 20.780434, "rank": 1973, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Foetal hypophysectomy or bilateral adrenalectomy, carried out in utero at about 100 or 125 days gestation respectively, increased the length of gestation in sheep. It was confirmed that pregnancy was not prolonged significantly if hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy was carried out on one of a pair of twins. The hypophysectomized foetus was, however, smaller and the adrenalectomized foetus larger, than the unoperated twin. 2. In about half of the previously operated foetuses intravascular catheters were inserted into both mother and foetus, either at about 125 days, for a comparison with normal catheterized foetuses, or during the post-mature period. Both adrenalectomized and hypophysectomized foetuses appeared to have little resistance to stress or infection and the majority survived only 1-2 weeks after the insertion of catheters. 3. Maternal peripheral plasma oestrogen, progesterone and corticosteroid concentrations did not appear to be altered by either foetal hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy and were maintained in the normal range during prolonged gestation. 4. Foetal plasma oestrogen concentrations were significantly lower after hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy than values found in control lambs. Plasma progesterone values were low in all three groups of foetuses. 5. Plasma corticosteroid concentrations after foetal hypophysectomy (12-6 ng/ml.) or adrenalectomy (14-7 ng/ml.) were in the same range as the values for control lambs before the pre-partum rise (14-6 ng/ml.). However, there was a small but significant maternal-to-foetal plasma corticosteroid gradient in the two operated groups whereas this difference was not found in the control animals. 6. Tissue glycogen concentrations were measured in non-catheterized adrenalectomized and hypophysectomized foetuses. In these two groups, whether examined before 149 days or after prolonged gestation, liver glycogen concentrations were 30-40% of those in non-catheterized control foetuses at term. In other respects there was little apparent difference between adrenalectomized and control foetuses. 7.

ES of the arcuate-ventromedial nuclei (medial basal hypothalamus; MBH) induced a prompt increase in serum LH that persisted throughout stimulation and returned to basal levels within 90 min thereafter. FSH was also released, but the release was slower and less dramatic than that of LH. Sham stimulation (0muA) caused no change in serum gonadotropins. The amount of LH released after MBH-ES depended upon current strength (1.0 mA greater than 0,5 or 0.7 mA). Three sequential 30-min MBH-ES trials at 90-min intervals induced comparable LH responses and 3 h of continuous MBH-ES maintained elevated serum LH levels throughout the stimulation period, suggesting that these stimulation period, suggesting that these stimulation parameters did not completely deplete pituitary stores of releasable LH. The character of the LH response was similar in individual monkeys through 3 to 24 trials during 4 to 18 months. Comparisons were made of the effects of estradiol-17beta (E2) treatment at different doses and for different intervals of time before MBH-ES. ES-induced LH release was not affected by low levels (25 and 55 pg/ml) ofE2 for 48 h, but was reduced by higher E2 concentrations (100 or 230 pg/ml). E2 concentrations of 100 pg/ml had no effect at 24 h, but reduced MBH-ES-activated LH release at 48 to 96 h; the degree of depression was time-related (48 h less than 72 h less than 96 h). ES of the preoptic-suprachiasmatic region (rostral hypothalamus; RH) in non-E2-treated monkeys also released LH, but this increase was less than after MBH-ES. FSH release was not measurable after RH-ES. In contrast to the depressed LH response to MBH-ES after 48 h of E2 (100 pg/ml), the response to RH-ES was not inhibited by this E2 regimen. These data suggest that ES of an area extending caudally from the rostral hypothalamus to the arcurate-median eminence region will evoke LH release in rhesus monkeys.

Particular attention was given to the four major electrophoretic components (designated as Nos. 2, 3, 5, and 8) of the 10 previously identified as organelle-specific products. Inhibition of cytoplasmic protein synthesis with emetine or cycloheximide causes a rapid decline in the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis, with an estimated half-life of 1 to 2 h, affecting in a parallel way all the discrete components. About 30% of the original synthetic activity appears to be resistant to emetine treatment for at least 24 h; however, all the polypeptides synthesized after the first 4 h of cell exposure to emetine are metabolically unstable, possibly because of lack of integration into the inner mitochondrial membrane. An analysis of the stability of newly synthesized products of mitochondrial protein synthesis pulse-labeled in the presence of cycloheximide and then chased in the absence of the drug (i.e. under conditions of resumed cytoplasmic protein synthesis) has revealed marked differences among the various discrete components. In particular, about three-fourths of the radioactivity associated with components 3 and 5 decays within 4 h of chase, the remainder being substantailly stable afterwards; by contrast, the radioactivity in components 2 and 8 shows only a slow decline during a 3-day chase. If the chase is carried out under conditions of a persistent block of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, as is the situation after a pulse labeling in the presence of emetine, all newly synthesized components appear to be destablized in various degrees, with the exception of component 5, which is to a great extent stabilized. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis with chloramphenicol has a progressive stabilizing effect on most of the discrete components newly synthesized after removal of the drug; this effect is especially striking in the case of component 5 which, in experiments of continuous labeling in the presence of emetine after prolonged chloramphenicol treatment, becomes, after 24 h of labeling or more, the only recognizable peak in the electrophoretic pattern of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-lysed mitochondrial fraction. The results of the kinetic experiments described here are interpreted in terms of two roles of cytoplasmically synthesized proteins, one required for the synthesis of polypeptides within the organelles, the other necessary for the stabilization of the mitochondrial products.", "pmid": "838736", "mesh_set": "D002455 D003513 D006367 D007700 D008928 D009363 D014176 D013997", "score": 14.143015, "rank": 5014, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Morphologic demonstration of tubular obstruction in acute renal failure.", "abstract": "We used the qualitative Hanssen technique in albino rats to seek morphologic demonstration of tubular obstruction in two types of acute renal failure: one induced by folic acid and another by methemoglobin. Immediately after the intravenous injection of folic acid, 250 mg/kg body weight, the animals became almost anuric. Two to three hours after the injection, sodium ferrocyanide remained within the proximal convoluted tubules. After the intravenous injection of methemoglobin, 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg body weight, the animals became oliguric but not anuric. Sodium ferrocyanide injected with methemoglobin was seen mainly in distal tubules and collecting ducts 2 to 3 hours after the injection. The degree of tubular dilatation was more marked in the former model than in the latter, in agreement with the degree of oliguria. These morphologic findings were taken to indicate that the above two types of acute renal failure were caused by tubular obstruction rather than by intrarenal vasoconstriction and subsequent cessation of glomerular filtration.

{"title": "Compartmentalization of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase in heart tissue.", "abstract": "In rabbit heart homogenates about 50% of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was associated with the low speed particulate fraction. In homogenates of rat or beef heart this fraction represented approximately 30% of the activity. The percentage of the enzyme in the particulate fraction was not appreciably affected either by preparing more dilute homogenates or by aging homogenates for up to 2 h before centrifugation. The particulate enzyme was not solubilized at physiological ionic strength or by the presence of exogenous proteins during homogenization. However, the holoenzyme or regulatory subunit could be solubilized either by Triton X-100, high pH, or trypsin treatment. In hearts of all species studied, the particulate-bound protein kinase was mainly or entirely the type II isozyme, suggesting isozyme compartmentalization. In rabbit hearts perfused in the absence of hormones and homogenized in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl, at least 50% of the cAMP in homogenates was associated with the particulate fraction. Omitting NaCl reduced the amount of particulate-bound cAMP. Most of the particulate-bound cAMP was probably associated with the regulatory subunit in this fraction since approximately 70% of the bound nucleotide was solubilized by addition of homogeneous catalytic subunit to the particulate fraction. The amount of cAMP in the particulate fraction (0.16 nmol/g of tissue) was approximately one-half the amount of the regulatory subunit monomer (0.31 nmol/g of tissue) in this fraction. The calculated amount of catalytic subunit in the particulate fraction was 0.18 nmol/g of tissue. Either epinephrine alone or epinephrine plus 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine increased the cAMP content of the particulate and supernatant fractions. The cAMP level was increased more in the supernatant fraction, possibly because the cAMP level became saturating for the regulatory subunit in the particulate fraction. The increase in cAMP was associated with translocation of a large percentage of the catalytic subunit activity from the particulate to the supernatant fraction. The distribution of the regulatory subunit of the enzyme was not significantly affected by this treatment. The catalytic subunit translocation could be mimicked by addition of cAMP to homogenates before centrifugation. The data suggest that the regulatory subunit of the protein kinase, at least that of isozyme II, is bound to particulate material, and theactive catalytic subunit is released by formation of the regulatory subunit-cAMP complex when the tissue cAMP concentration is elevated. A model for compartmentalized hormonal control is presented.", "pmid": "16921", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002352 D002417 D000242 D004837 D006863 D007527 D008297 D009206 D011092 D011494 D011817 D051381 D012965 D013045 D013329 D013347 D014357 D014970", "score": 15.211676, "rank": 4500, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Applied for 18 h at 4 degrees C in the dark, ZIO reacts at pH 4.2--4.0 fairly selectively with the matrix of synaptic vesicles. Approximately 53% of the vesicles are completely and 4% partially stained. The percentage of ZIO-positive vesicles is increased to nearly 90% and reduced to 4% or less by pretreatment with SH-protecting (dithiothreitol) or SH-blocking (N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid) and SH-oxidizing (azodicarboxylic acid-bis-dimethylamide) reagents, respectively. Stimulation of the motor nerve at 20 Hz for 7 min, partially fatiguing synaptic transmission, reduces the number of vesicles per square micrometer of terminal area by approximately 52%; 2 min of rest restores this number of its pre-stimulation level. These changes are chiefly accounted for by changes in the number of completely ZIO-positive vesicles. 2 min after the end of stimulation, partially ZIO-positive vesicles are three times more frequent than before. With all experimental conditions, the average volume of vesicles was as follows: ZIO-negative less than partially ZIO-positive less than completely ZIO-positive. The average volume of ZIO-positive vesicles is almost unaffected by stimulation; that of ZIO-negative vesicles is decreased by 25% immediately after stimulation, increasing with subsequent rest to the initial level after 1 h. It is suggested (a) that ZIO demonstrates intravesicular protein(s) containing SH-groups and (b) that the completely ZIO-positive vesicles represent the mature ones ready to be used for transmitter release.

The daily food intake was similar within each sex (females 9-11 g/day and males 10-13 g/day). Only males fed glucose consumed significantly more food than any other group (12.9 g/day). Rats fed fructose had the greatest liver weight and total lipid content. The hepatic malic enzyme activity of both sexes was significantly higher in rats fed fructose than in those fed cornstarch. Small intestinal malic enzyme activity was largely unaffected by diet. The serum immunoreactive insulin level of rats fed fructose was the lowest, and the level in females was higher than in males fed fructose or glucose.

Cathepsin D-I was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. It had properties common to other ordinary cathepsins D in terms of the elution position from a DEAE-cellulose column at pH 8.0, the pH-dependence of activity toward acid-denatured hemoglobin, and the molecular weight of 35,000 as determined by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. On the other hand, cathepsin D-II was purified about 1,000-fold by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100. It was a very acidic protein as judged from its elution position from a DEAE-cellulose column at pH 8.0, and the high mobility toward the anode on disc gel electrophoresis at pH 8.6. Its molecular weight was determined to be 35,000 by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration and 39,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was optimally active at pH 2.8 against acid-denatured hemoglobin as a substrate, showing 80% of the optimal activity at pH 1.0, and almost no activity above pH 4.0. This pH-profile of activity was similar to that of monkey pepsin C (gastricsin). It did not hydrolyze N-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine, a synthetic substrate for pepsin, but was inhibited by a series of pepsin inhibitors such as pepstatin, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane, p-bromophenacyl bromide, and diazoacetyl-DL-norleucine methyl ester, although the diazo reagent was a rather weak inhibitor of the enzyme.

The characteristics of benzofuroxan (benzofurazan 1-oxide, benzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole N-oxide) that relate to its application as a reactivity probe for the study of environments of thiol groups are discussed. 2. To establish a kinetic and mechanistic basis for its use as a probe, a kinetic study of its reaction with 2-mercaptoethanol was carried out. 3. This reaction appears to proceed by a rate-determining attack of the thiolate ion on one of the electrophilic centres of benzofuroxan (possibly C-6) to provide a low steady-state concentration of an intermediate adduct; rapid reaction of this adduct with a second molecule of thiol gives the disulphide and o-benzoquinone dioxime. 4. The effects of the different types of environment that proteins can provide on the kinetic characteristics of reactions of thiol groups with benzofuroxan are delineated. 5.

{"title": "Proton translocation in chloroplasts and its relationship to electron transport between the photosystems.", "abstract": "Using dark adapted isolated spinach chloroplasts and sequences of brief saturating flashes the correlation of the uptake and release of protons with electron transport from Photosystem II to Photosystem I were studied. The following observations and conclusions are reported: (1) Flash-induced proton uptake shows a weak, damped binary oscillation, with maxima occurring after the 2nd, 4th, etc. flashes. The damping factor is comparable to that observed in the O2 flash yield oscillation and therefore explained by misses in Photosystem II. (2) On the average and after a steady state is reached, each flash (i.e. each reduction of Q) induces the uptake of 2H+ from outside the chloroplasts. (3) Flash induced proton release inside the chloroplast membrane shows a strong damped binary oscillation with maximum release occurring also after the 2nd, 4th, etc. flashes. (4) This phenomenon is correlated with the earlier reported binary oscillations of electron transport [2] and shows that both electrons and protons are transported in pairs between the photosystems. (5) In two sequential flashes 4H+ from the outside of the thylakoid and 2e- from water are accumulated at a binding site B. Subsequently, the two electrons are transferred to non-protonated acceptors in Photosystem I (probably plastocyanin and cytochrome f) and the 4H+ are released inside the thylakoid.

{"title": "Mechanism of rat liver microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturase. Studies of the substrate specificity, enzyme-substrate interactions, and the function of lipid.", "abstract": "The three purified proteins which are required for microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturation, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, and desaturase, have been combined with egg lecithin or dimyristyl lecithin vesicles to reconstruct a functional electron transport system capable of utilizing NADH and O2 in the desaturation of stearyl-CoA. Such preparations appear to consist of phospholipid vesicles which contain the three proteins bound to the outer surface of the vesicles. Acyl-CoA derivatives containing 12 to 19 carbon fatty acyl chains are required for desaturase activity while derivatives containing 9 to 20 carbons are capable of binding to the enzyme. Shorter chain acyl-CoA derivatives, free CoA, and free fatty acids do not appear to bind to the enzyme. Inhibition and analog studies suggest that the methylene chain of stearyl-CoA assumes an eclipsed (\"gauche\") conformation at carbon atoms 9,10 in the enzyme-substrate complex. Furthermore, isotope rate effects obtained with deuterated stearyl-CoA derivatives indicate that hydrogen removal is the rate-limiting step of desaturation. Stearyl-CoA binds to pure liposomes and desaturase-containing liposomes, and it is this form of stearyl-CoA which appears to be the substrate for desaturase. The Arrhenius plots of desaturase activity obtained using desaturase bound to egg lecithin liposomes, in which the liquid crystalline to crystalline phase transition temperature is -5 degrees, was linear between 15 and 35 degrees, while that obtained using desaturase bound to dimyristyl lecithin liposomes showed a break at 24 degrees coinciding with the liquid crystalline to crystalline phase transition temperature for this lipid. The decrease observed in the deuterium isotope rate effect below the transition temperature indicates that a step in the reaction sequence other than hydrogen abstraction becomes rate-limiting when the lipid is in the crystalline state. In this system translational diffusion does not emerge as the rate-limiting step. The liposomes contained sufficient reductase and cytochrome b5 so that translational diffusion was not rate-limiting.", "pmid": "8453", "mesh_set": "D000818 D003579 D003580 D003903 D044943 D007700 D008081 D008854 D008862 D010713 D051381 D013230 D013329", "score": 13.5443, "rank": 5246, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "The effect of endogenous phosphate on the H+/Mn2+ ratio and the state of Mn2+ in the mitochondrial matrix.", "abstract": "1. Kinetics and stoichiometry of H+ extrusion and reuptake and of Mn2+ uptake and release have been measured in respiring liver mitochondria in the absence of external added Pi. H+ and Mn2+ fluxes are parallel during aerobic cation uptake but not during uncoupler induced cation release. The H+/Mn2+ is 1.24. Addition of SH reagents, in concentrations inhibiting the Pi carrier, modifies the kinetics of H+ extrusion and of Mn2+ uptake and release. The slow phase of uncoupler induced Mn2+ release is diminished. The H+/Mn2+ is increased to 1.72. Addition of SH reagents, after the phase of aerobic uptake is completed, results in a significant reduction of the extent of uncoupler-induced Mn2+ release. The extent of reuptake of endogenous Pi during aerobic uptake of Mn2+ is about 8 nmol x mg protein-1. 2. Aerobic uptake of Mn2+ in the absence of external Pi results in an electron spin resonance spectrum which is the sum of two components. One, denoted as S, corresponds to Mn(H2O)2+(6). Another denoted as E, reflects spin exchange narrowing. In contrast to previous claims the following evidence suggests that the spin exchange component is due to Mn3(PO4)2 precipitate: (a) the dimension of the spin exchange spectrum is markedly reduced by abolition of Pi transport; (b) the spin exchange spectrum is released very slowly by addition of uncouplers under conditions where uncouplers cause a rapid deenergization of mitochondria, reuptake of H+ and release of cations; (c) the free matrix Mn2+ is released slowly after addition of uncoupler if there is a large spin exchange signal; howeover the free matrix Mn2+ is abolished rapidly by uncoupler when formation of the spin exchange signal is prevented by pretreatment with Ca2+; (d) the band width of the spin exchange fraction is independent of the Mn2+/protein ratio either under kinetic or steady state conditions; (e) the experimental spectrum recalls closely that obtained by computer simulation by assuming it as a combination of Mn(H2O)2+(6) and Mn3(PO4)2. 3. It is concluded that endogenous Pi affects the process of aerobic divalent cation uptake. A part of Mn2+ uptake in the absence of externally added anions, consists of a Mn3(PO4)2 precipitate.

At 25 degrees C binding reaches equilibrium within 20 min and is reversible upon addition of excess phentolamine. Binding is saturable with 183+/-22 fmol of [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine bound per mg of protein at saturation, corresponding to 220+/-26 sites per platelet. Kinetic and equilibrium studies indicate the dissociation constant of [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine for the receptors is 1-3 nM. The specificity of the binding sites is typical of an alpha-adrenergic receptor. Catecholamine agonists compete for occupancy of the [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites with an order of potency (-)epinephrine> (-)norepinephrine>> (-)isoproterenol. Stereospecificity was demonstrated inasmuch as the (+)isomers of epinephrine and norepinephrine were 10-20-fold less potent than the (-)isomers. The potent alpha-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine, and yohimbine competed potently for the sites, whereas beta-antagonists such as propranolol and dichlorisoproterenol were quite weak. Dopamine and serotonin competed only at high concentrations (0.1 mM). The [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites could also be demonstrated in intact platelets where they displayed comparable specificity, stereospecificity, and saturability. Saturation binding studies with the intact platelets indicated 220+/-45 receptors per platelet, in good agreement with the value derived from studies with platelet lysates. Ability of alpha-adrenergic agonists to inhibit adenylate cyclase and of alpha-adrenergic antagonists to antagonize this inhibitory effect directly paralleled ability to interact with the [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites.

The concentration of free steroids (CS) increases in both fetal and maternal plasma during labor and delivery. Fetal levels are higher after vaginal than after cesarean section. These differences may indicate an important role of the fetal adrenal gland in the induction of labor or they may reflect merely the fetal response to the stress of delivery. During incrased intrauterine stress steroid secretion is increased as shown here. We examined 41 mothers and their infants during pathological labor. Pathology was assessed from fetal acidosis and/or a clinically obstetric disease of the mother or fetus. The 41 cases included 9 cesarean sections, 8 forceps deliveries; 24 spontaneous deliveries of which 7 were premature. At the time of delivery the pH and CS level were determined in maternal and umbilical vessels in all cases. During spontaneous labor blood samples were also taken during the different stages of labour. A competetive protein binding assay with transcortin without fractionation of the steroids was used. Progesteron was determined by the same assay. The level of this hormone, however, remains unchanged and hence any changes reflect changes in CS. The levels of CS were correlated with the pH values and compared to previously obtained normal values. During pathological deliveries CS levels in both mother and fetus are normal as long as there is no acidosis (Fig. 1). If acidosis is present the CS level in the umbilical artery is usually higher than normal. In 13 out of 18 vaginal deliveries the CS level was above normal, in the other 5 at the upper limit of normal (Fig. 1 and 2). At the same time the a--v difference becomes smaller and sometimes even negative. No changes were noted in maternal and umbilical venous blood (Tab. I and II). Similar dependence on the pH was found for cesarean sections (Tab. III). In premature deliveries without acidosis in the umbilical artery the CS levels were lower in both mother and fetus (Tab. I).

Exposure of spontaneously secreting or metiamide-treated fundic pouches to a relatively high concentration of luminal acid. HCl 120 mM, for 60 min, led to a marked net loss of luminal H+ which was associated with a significant decrease in the intramural pH (7.28 +/- 0.09 to 6.88 +/- 0.10 and 7.23 +/- 0.07 to 6.99 +/- 0.09, respectively). A linear relationship was observed between the rates of net disappearance of luminal acid and the intramural pH. All 10 spontaneously secreting and five metiamide-treated pouches had superficial mucosal erosions. In contrast, when fundic pouches were exposed to luminal acid in histamine-treated animals, the net loss of luminal H+ was negligible and the intramural pH remained at its base-line level (7.25 +/- 0.07). Histamine stimulation without acid in the lumen caused a small but insignificant increase in the intramural pH (7.27 +/- 0.03 to 7.39 +/- 0.05). Only three of the eight histamine-treated fundic pouches had lesions. In the antral pouches the intramural pH changes in response to exposure to luminal acid were smaller and histamine treatment did not influence the intramural pH. None of the antral pouches had lesions. The results suggest that acidification of the tissue by the diffusion of luminal acid may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of acute gastric ulceration. The acid secretory state of the gastric mucosa can significantly influence the acid-base balance in the mucosa and thus modify its response to acid diffusing from the lumen.

Ions of manganese and vanadium are especially effective, as are o-phenanthroline complexes of iron. Cobalt ions are less active. The D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3) from kidney and the L-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.2) from snake venom likewise cause HCN production from histidine when supplemented with the particulate preparation from Chlorella or with peroxidase or with a redox metal ion. The stereospecificity of the amino acid oxidase determines which of the two stereoisomers of histidine is active as an HCN precursor. Though histidine is the best substrate for HCN production, other naturally occurring aromatic amino acids (viz. tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan) can also serve as HCN precursors with these enzyme systems.

{"title": "The effects of prolonged fasting on plasma triglyceride kinetics in man.", "abstract": "Studies were undertaken to examine triglyceride turnover in obese humans on isocaloric balanced diets and during prolonged (3-5 wk) fasting. The data were related to plasma concentrations of insulin (IRI), glucagon (IRG), and free fatty acids (FFA) and to blood ketone concentrations. The triglyceride turnover rates were also related to the plasma triglyceride concentration. This relationship was the same in the obese on isocaloric balanced diets as that we have previously observed in lean humans on similar diets. The relationship between triglyceride turnover and concentration changed during prolonged fasting in a way that suggested that triglyceride removal was impaired. This viewpoint is consistent with the known effects of fasting on adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity. In another group of fasted obese, refed with a hypocaloric diet, the relationship returned toward normal. In addition to the impaired triglyceride removal, prolonged fasting resulted in a decrease in triglyceride production. This decrease occurred despite an increase in plasma FFA. After 3-5 wk of fasting the IRI was about 50% of the initial value, while the IRG was the same as the initial value. While triglyceride production fell during fasting, the blood ketone concentration rose. Others have seen similar changes in ketones and triglycerides in livers perfused with medium in which the ratio of insulin to glucagon fell. The rate of triglyceride production was not related to body weight. However, regardless of nutritional state, it was positively related to the basal plasma insulin levels.

{"title": "Solvent effects on the structure of rabbit Clq, a subcomponent of the first component of complement.", "abstract": "The effect of solvent conditions on the conformation of rabbit Clq was studied by both spectroscopic and nonspectroscopic methods. The conformation of Clq in buffered saline solutions at pH 7.4 or 6.0 did not differ significantly from Clq at twice the saline concentration as determined with circular dichroism, difference spectroscopy, and tritium-hydrogen exchange techniques. Addition of calcium to the buffers had no structural effects in any of the conditions examined. Hydrogen exchange experiments performed at pH 7.4 were also unaffected by magnesium, manganese, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. With all the methods used a pH effect was observable between 5.1 and 8.3. From solvent perturbation difference spectroscopy results it was calculated that the equivalent of 10 +/- 2 and 6 +/- 1 mol of tyrosine and tryptophan/mol of Clq, respectively, became exposed at the lower pH. A small positive CD band in the 231 to 235 nm region decreased in wavelength and increased in magnitude as a function of decreasing pH, indicating tyrosine exposure at the lower pH and possibly changes in the collagen-like structure of Clq. Hydrogen exchange experiments indicate a small, but significant, conformation transition occurring in the pH 5 region and a stabilization of conformation between pH 6 to 8. From these results the conformational pH dependence was interpreted as an acid expansion of Clq with a minor conformational transition occurring between pH 5 AND 6.

{"title": "Gastric secretion and fermentation in the suckling pig.", "abstract": "1. The contribution to acidification of the stomach contents of pigs by hydrochloric acid secretion or by lactic acid produced by fermentation was studied in fifteen suckling pigs from six litters born and reared either in a 'conventional' environment or in an isolated 'clean' environment. Sequential samples of stomach contents obtained during periods of up to 24 h were analysed for their chloride and lactic acid contents, pH and total titratable acidity. These values gave a measure of organic and inorganic acids respectively. 2. Six pigs from two litters born and reared in a 'clean' environment had acid secretion in the stomach at 2 d of age, and the concentrations of lactic acid in stomach contents remained low (0-40 mmol/l) throughout the suckling period. 3. Eight pigs from three litters born and reared in a 'conventional' environment, and a ninth pig born in this environment but moved to the 'clean' environment at 24 h of age, had lactic acid in concentrations of up to 250 mmol/l in stomach contents within the 1st week of life. The pattern of lactic acid production (and hence the acidity of stomach contents) was governed by frequency of suckling. 4. Both between- and within-litter variation in the age of onset of HC1 secretion was evident in the group reared in a 'conventional' environment, and when HC1 secretion did occur it was usually accompanied by a reduction in lactic acid production. 5. It is concluded: (1) that the environment at birth is important in determining the fermentative ability of the stomach flora; (2) that if lactic acid is produced in large amounts in the stomach, it may partly or completely inhibit acidification by HC1.", "pmid": "7286", "mesh_set": "D000818 D000831 D002712 D004777 D005232 D005260 D005285 D005747 D005750 D006863 D007773 D007774 D008297 D011247 D013270 D013552", "score": 15.129223, "rank": 4536, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

A decrease in pH reduced the threshold inhibitory concentration of calcium and the calcium concentration producing an inhibition of 50% of the enzyme activity. 2. Calcium reduced the apparent affinity of the enzyme of Na+, this effect occurred only at pH 7.4. 3. Calcium increased the apparent affinity of the enzyme for K+, this effect was enhanced at acidic pH. 4. Activation of the enzyme by Na+ for a constant Na+ : K+ ratio has been studied at pH 7.4 and at pH 6.8 in the absence and in the presence of 3.10(-4) M Ca 2+; the results of this experiment indicate that Ca2+ effect at pH 7.4 was not influenced by Na+ -- K+ competition and was probably due to a Na+ -- Ca2+ interaction. 5. At pH 7.4, the calcium inhibitory threshold concentration and the concentration producing 50% inhibition were reduced when Na+ was low; at pH 6.8, the calcium inhibition was not markedly modified by the change of Na+ concentration. 6. The Ca2+ -activated ATPase of myosin B which is related to the contractile behaviour of muscle and the Ca2+  -ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which is related to the ability of this structure to accumulate calcium were activated in a range of calcium concentration producing an inhibition of (Na2+ + K+) -ATPase. The present results indicate that the increase by acidity of the (Na2+ + K+) -ATPase sensitivity to calcium might be due to a suppression of a Na+ -Ca2+ interaction. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that calcium might inhibit the Na+ -pump during the repolarization phase of the action potential and that, by this effect, it might control cell excitability.", "pmid": "14690", "mesh_set": "D000251 D000818 D001665 D002118 D004789 D006168 D006863 D009206 D009218 D011188 D012519 D012964", "score": 24.11606, "rank": 1168, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Pretreatment with the antihistamine derivative, Pfizer UK-9040, decreased both basal and stimulated acid secretion, whereas plasma gastrin levels increased and the antral G-cells were emptied of gastrin. These results suggest that this antihistamine derivative decreases gastric acid secretion by a direct action on the parietal cells and not by reducing gastrin release from the G-cells.

This response appears to be mediated through polyamine metabolism because ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17)activity is markedly increased shortly after promoter exposure and this induction varies in magnitude according to dose and promoter potency of a series of phorbol esters. In vitro, exogenous putrescine (0.01-10 mM) results in a dose-related increase and prolongation of promoter-stimulated DNA DNA synthesis, a phenomenon noted in other systems of polyamine-mediated growth stimulation. The anti-inflammatory steroid fluocinolone acetonide (FA), an inhibitor of tumor promotion, prevents TPA stimulation of epidermal proliferation in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, FA most effectively prevents stimulation of DNA synthesis when applied is not required. Paradoxially, FA potentiates the increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity after TPA administeration both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the inhibition of TPA-stimulated DNA synthesis by FA in vitro can be reversed by exogenous putrescine.

The adenylate cyclase of this corticosteroid-producing, transplanted, adrenal cancer of the rat was stimulated not only by adrenocorticotropic hormone and fluoride, but also by the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The adenylate cyclase of normal adrenal tissue was unresponsive to isoproterenol. Direct binding studies with the specific high affinity B-adrenergic ligand, (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol, demonstrated the pressure of 0.094 pmol of specific binding sites per milligram of tumor membrane protein. By contrast, normal adrenal membranes contained too few binding sites to accurately measure and study using these techniques. The tumor binding sites had high affinity for (-)[3H] dihydroalprenolol with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2.1 nM. Adrenergic agonists competed for the binding sites in an order of potency, [(-) isoproterenol greater than (-) epinephrine (-) norepinephrine], paralleling their order of potency as beta-adrenergic agonists. The beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-) propranolol, competed for binding, causing half-mzximal inhibition of specific binding at a concentration of 6 nM. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, and several catecholamine metabolites and precursors did not effectively compete for the binding sites at high concentrations.

{"title": "Activation of soluble guanylate cyclase from rat lung by incubation or by hydrogen peroxide.", "abstract": "A 37,000 X g supernatant fraction prepared from fat lung homogenate demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in guanylate cyclase activity after incubation at 30 degrees for 30 min (preincubation). Treatment of the supernatant fraction with Triton X-100 increased activity to approximately the same extent as preincubation, but would not increase the activity after preincubation. By chromatography on Sepharose 2B, before and after preincubation, it was demonstrated that the increase in activity was only associated with the soluble guanylate cyclase, and not the particulate enzyme. Activation by preincubation required O2. It was completely inhibited by thiols such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and by bovine serum albumin, KCN, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. These inhibitors suggested a copper requirement for activation, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that 20 to 60 muM CuCl2 could relieve the inhibition by 0.1 mM sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. 2-Mercaptoethanol inhibition could also be reversed by removal of the thiol on a Sephadex G-25 column, however, this treatment partially activated the enzyme. Addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to a preincubated preparation would not reverse the activation. H2O2 was found to activate guanylate cyclase, either by its generation in the lung supernatant with glucose oxidase and glucose, or by its addition to a preparation in which the catalase was inhibited with KCN. KCN or bovine serum albumin was able to partially inhibit activation by glucose oxidase plus glucose, however, larger amounts of glucose oxidase could overcome that inhibition, indicating a catalytic role for Cu2+ at low H2O2 concentrations. No direct evidence for H2O2 formation during preincubation could be found, however, indirect evidence was obtained by the spectrophotometric detection of choleglobin formation from hemoglobin present in the lung supernatant fluid.

By fitting to the formula, P (% specfic release) = 100 (1-e-Nat) one obtains alpha, the relative frequency of CTL in N lymphoid cells. Using a microassay and murine sarcoma target cells, we observed an unexpected decrease in lysis whenever effectors obtained from a graft-vs-host reaction were tested at high concentrations. This inhibition was not observed with CTL generated by an MLC reaction. Inhibition could not be explained by nonspecific mechanical 'crowding', reutilization of released isotope, suppression of release from dead target cells, or the particular strain combination and target used. By modifying the formula to allow suppression of CTL by a stochastic cell-cell interaction with suppessor cell, we found that P = 100 (1-e-Nate-Ngamma) adequately fitted the data, where Ngamma is proportional to inhibitor content. An 18- to 24-hr incubation at 37 degrees C but not 4 degrees C allowed selective depletion or enrichment of inhibitors; in mixing experiments, both parameters Nalpha t and Ngamma behaved stoichiometrically as independent cellular properties.

CD-3400-induced gastric lesions were fewer in number than those produced with reserpine and rescinnamine in fasted rats. After a three day treatment of CD-3400 to fed rats, however, there were few gastric lesions, while reserpine- and rescinnamine-induced gastric lesions were aggravated to a greater extent that when a single administration was given to fasted rats. Influence of CD-3400, reserpine and rescinnamine on the healing process of acetic acid-induced ulcer was insignificant, but treatment with high doses of reserpine and rescinnamine resulted in death. Pretreatment with CD-3400 and reserpine produced a decrease in gastric acid and K+, and an increase in Na+. Repeated administration of reserpine for 5 days resulted in a decrease of both gastric volume and acid, while such was not seen with CD-3400. Treatment with anticholinergic agents such as atropine sulfate and atropine methylbromide inhibited CD-3400- and reserpine-induced gastric lesions. From these results, it would appear that cholinergic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of CD-3400-induced gastric lesions, as in the case with reserpine, and that the responses of these lesions to reserpine and CD-3400 correlate with changes of ionic fluxes in gastric juice.", "pmid": "14871", "mesh_set": "D000085 D000818 D001286 D004305 D005750 D005753 D007279 D008297 D010276 D051381 D012110 D013272 D013276", "score": 16.259687, "rank": 3956, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In addition to their different localization in the cells, the PDE forms of Rh. rubrum differ in their ratios to the concentrations of hydrogen ions and bivalent metals; the latter difference, however, may be accounted for by the effect of a protein modulator of PDE.

To differentiate between the silver grains originating from 'sedentary' or 'migratory' proteins, the radioactivity in dendritic areas free of ribosomes and rich in ribosomes was determined separately. Several conclusions were reached. (1) Protein synthesis in dendrites takes place mainly in the proximal parts although a slight synthetic activity can be observed along the whole dendritic tress as well. (2) Newly synthesized proteins are transported toward the distal dendritic region; the data obtained suggest that cisterns of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the microtubular system may be involved in this transport.

Amino acids whose amino groups are located at a position other than the alpha are almost ineffective. With all these rigid stereospecificities of the sugar receptor for amino acids, certain replacement of the alpha-amino group with the hydroxyl or carbonyl group shows a slight increase of the response at neutral pH. Furthermore, certain fatty acids can stimulate the sugar receptor once the solutions are buffered at neutral pH. This observation was further supported by the presence of a remarkable similarity of stimulating effectiveness between amino acids that can stimulate the sugar receptor and those fatty acids.

{"title": "Collagen cross-linking. Effect of D-penicillamine on cross-linking in vitro.", "abstract": "D-Pencillamine is believed to inhibit collagen cross-link biosynthesis by forming thiazolidine rings with lysyl-derived aldehydes that are intermediates in bifunctional cross-link synthesis. Recently, we showed that aldehyde biosynthesis catalyzed by lysyl oxidase occurs after the onset of fibril formation and that nascent aldehydes form Schiff-base cross-links rapidly in fibrils. This suggested that the accessibility of D-penicillamine to most aldehydes formed during cross-link synthesis might be limited. To study this, reconstituted chick bone collagen fibrils were incubated in vitro with highly purified lysyl oxidase and D-penicillamine. As reported in previous studies in vivo, allysine content increased and polyfunctional cross-link synthesis decreased with D-penicillamine. However, the concentration of bifunctional cross-links increased rather than decreased due to a 2-fold increase in N6:6'-dehydro-5,5'-dihydroxylysinonorleucine. Hydroxyallysine, an intermediate in formation of this Schiff base, decreased. A time study indicated that allysine levels increased primarily after the bulk of Schiff base synthesis. These results indicate that D-penicillamine does not inhibit bifunctional cross-link synthesis as previously suggested. Its principal effect is to block synthesis of polyfunctional cross-link products from Schiff base cross-link precursors and to cause accumulation of these precursors. This effect may be due to interference with the close molecular packing required for polyfunctional cross-link synthesis. These results also suggest a mechanism for the relative insensitivity of tissues such as bone with high hydroxylysine content to D-penicillamine. In this study, D-penicillamine caused selective accumulation of allysyl and not hydroxyallysyl residues. In bone as opposed to soft tissues, hydroxyallysyl residues are intermediates in synthesis of almost all cross-links.", "pmid": "13066", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001665 D001842 D002356 D002645 D003094 D006710 D006711 D007700 D046911 D008715 D010396 D011485 D008249", "score": 14.515693, "rank": 4853, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The extent of damage to each raphe nucleus was quantified histologically by means of a simplified formaldehyde histochemical method for visualization of serotonin in cryostat sections. A detailed mapping of the distribution of the yellow-fluorescent raphe perikarya provided the basis for quantification. Tryptophan hydroxylase activity was measured in 6 forebrain regions from each animal, and the results were correlated with the per cent damage to each raphe nucleus. Tyrosine hydroxylase was also assayed in 5 of these regions; it was not significantly affected by any of the raphe lesions. Dorsal raphe lesions reduced tryptophan hydroxylase activity in the striatum, thalamus, cortex, and hypothalamus, but not in the septal nuclei or hippocampus. Damage to B8 resulted in decrements in this serotonergic enzyme in the septal nuclei, hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum or thalamus. Lesions of the scattered B9 cells had no significant effect on enzyme activity in any region examined. These data suggest that the dorsal and median raphe nuclei provide two distinct though perhaps overlapping serotonergic systems innervating different parts of the forebrain: a mesostriatal pathway originating in B7 and a mesolimbic system derived from B8. Behavioral studies on the animals, which are presented in a companion paper, indicated that damage to the median nucleus is responsible for many of the behavioral effects previously reported after combined lesions of both major raphe nuclei.", "pmid": "6112", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001931 D002540 D003342 D006624 D007031 D008032 D008297 D009434 D051381 D012154 D012688 D012701 D013788 D014365 D014446", "score": 24.393435, "rank": 1113, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Furthermore, with hyperosmolal NaCl the dilation developed within 1 minute; its rate and extent of development were concentration-dependent; it manifested an obligate association with prior or concomitant T-tubular dilation and was not readily reversible. We conclude that (1) the technique sensitively measures in situ changes of LSR volume; (2) most of LSR luminal water is osmotically responsive, but a significant fraction may not be; (3) exposure to hyperosomolal solutions may bring about (perhaps irreversible) structural changes in the diadic membrane complex, leading to changes in its solute permeability.", "pmid": "844148", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002463 D004305 D008094 D009206 D009996 D051381 D012462 D012519 D012965 D013395", "score": 11.884289, "rank": 5787, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Bearing in mind the known inhibition, by ADP, of sn-phospho-3-glycerate (3-phosphoglycerate) reduction it is concluded that the lag in O2 evolution results from the production of ribulose 5-phosphate from fructose bisphosphate and that this in turn inhibits the reoxidation of NADPH by adversely affecting the ADP/ATP ratio.

The products (2 and 3) were isolated by extraction from the fermentations followed by chromatographic purification. Identification was by comparison of various physical properties and spectral data with those of authentic materials obtained by chemical means. Catalytic activity of the crude enzyme preparations of S. nogalater was lost by dialysis by restored by addition of TPNH although not by addition of DPNH demonstrating TPNH dependence. The reaction rate increased linearly with added crude enzyme protein up to 4 mg/ml and was highest between pH 6.5 and 7.0.", "pmid": "20436", "mesh_set": "D000900 D001711 D002474 D005285 D006027 D006863 D009279 D010084 D013302 D013997", "score": 12.973856, "rank": 5468, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Immunoreactive serum opsonic alpha 2 sb glycoprotein as a noninvasive index of RES systemic defense after trauma.", "abstract": "Reticuloendothelial system (RES) depression has been correlated with diminished resistance to trauma, shock, and sepsis in man and animals. Previous studies have related the depression of RES hepatic Kupffer cell phagocytic function after trauma to diminished bioassayable opsonic activity. The present study determined if the loss of biological activity and RES alteration correlated with immunoreactive serum opsonic alpha 2 SB glycoprotein levels after trauma. Serum opsonic activity was measured by liver slice bioassay, and immunoreactive opsonic protein was measured by rocket electroimmunoassay. RE function was determined by colloid clearance over a 24-hour post-trauma period. Anesthetized rats (250-300 gm) subjected to sublethal or severe (greater than LD50) whole-body NCD trauma were the shock models investigated. Immunoreactive levels in 63 rats prior to injury were 518 +/- 24 microgram/ml. Neither biological nor immunoreactive levels were altered over 24 hours in anesthetized sham-traumatized controls. Temporal alteration in the initial decrease and recovery pattern of biologically active and immunoreactive opsonic protein levels significantly correlated following both sublethal and severe injury. Moreover, the patterns of immunoreactive levels of the opsonic protein correlated with the functional phagocytic activity of the RES as determined by vascular clearance of a test dose of blood-borne radiolabeled particulates. This glycoprotein falls after trauma, and the magnitude and duration of the decline increases with severity of injury. Immunoreactive opsonic alpha 2 SB glycoprotein appears to be an accurate measurement of circulating opsonic activity and RE Kupffer cell function after trauma, especially with respect to clearance. Thus, immunoreactive opsonic protein warrants clinical consideration as a noninvasive measure of reticuloendothelial systemic defense in patients after trauma and burn.", "pmid": "262806", "mesh_set": "D000818 D005353 D007122 D008297 D012157 D009895 D010587 D051381 D011919 D013997 D014947", "score": 23.381918, "rank": 1307, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Serum antibody was also present. Two experiments have been completed in conventional rats and one in gnotobiotic rats in which the animals were immunized with crude enzyme antigens. The immunized groups of animals always had lower mean caries scores than comparably sham-immunized or nonimmunized control groups. Hamsters immunized with a defined enzyme preparation, containing no more than three antigenic components (two of which were enzyme), also demonstrated significant reductions in mean caries scores. The numbers of lesions were also always lower in immunized animals. In some cases there were reductions in the numbers of S. mutans that could be recovered from the teeth of immunized, infected animals. The reductions in dental caries and lesions were greater on smooth dental surfaces than on occlusal surfaces, which might be explained as interference with adherence phenomena demonstrated by S. mutans.

The study was performed in the Psychiatric Department at the Centro Femenil de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n Social, in Mexico City. A special feature of this study was that patients were confined for a legal process and consequently with restricted liberty. All were females between 19 to 44 years old, with an average age of 32.05 years. The methodology applied in this case was a modified double blind randomized procedure, using different color capsules with placebo or the active drug (yellow oxypertine and blue placebo). Patients received a 10 mg capsule every 12 hours (20 mg daily). The clinical measurement of anxiety was performed using the Visual Anxiety Scale (Murphy), evaluating each of its 11 parameters. The intensity was qualified from 0 to 3; at the end of each consultation a global assessment was made. Most of the patients were interviewed in five occasions during the treatment period. For each of the nine patients receiving during 4 weeks only oxypertine capsules (group I), the scores of the parameters of the scale were added, observing the following results: in seven excellent respond, fair in one and one abandoned the study since the beginning. In eight of the patients who received placebo (group II) also for a 4 weeks period, results were evaluated as follows: five excellent one good and two poor. It can be observed that both groups gave a similar final score at the end of the study, meaning that no significant benefits were obtained between the active drug and the placebo, in spite that anxiety decreased in most of them. In group III, seven cases initiated with placebo and after 2 weeks the capsule had to be changed to oxypertine due to stablization or increase in the anxiety. Results were excellent in three, good in two, poor in one and another case suspended the treatment when placebo was to be substituted. In this same group, six cases initiated treatment with oxypertine, and after two weeks or more the medication was changed to placebo due to the same reasons mentioned above. Results were fair in one and poor in five. A significant response was observed in those cases where oxypertine replaced placebo and no response was obtained when placebo substituted oxypertine. Few cases abandoned mainly for two reasons: satisfactory remission of the anxiety or symptoms exacerbation. Investigators emphasize that the psychological conditions of the patients studied in this trial were different from the ones who ordinarily assist to the out patient clinics or private practice, mainly because were subjects with legal and social problems, as already mentioned, confined in a rehabilitation center.

The method of estimating the intralysosomal pH by measuring the distribution of [14C]methylamine in lysosomes isolated from the livers of Triton WR 1339-treated rats has been critically examined. 2. In lysed lysosomes, methylamine is bound to the membrane fragments, but this binding can be completely suppressed by increasing the concentration of monovalent cations in the medium. 3. In intact lysosomes, the binding of [14C]methylamine is only partly inhibited by monovalent cations at 25 degrees C. 4. THe accumulation of [14C]methylamine in intact lysosomes is progressively inhibited as the concentration of methylamine is increased. A similar inhibition of [14C]methylamine accumulation is obtained with NH4Cl. 5. Similar values for the intralysosomal pH were obtained from measurements of the distribution of methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine, which are accumulated in the lysosomes, and of 5,5-dimethyloxazolidinedione-2,4, which is excluded. 6. The breakdown of endocytosed 123I-labelled bovine serum albumin by intact isolated lysosomes is much less sensitive to the pH of the medium than the breakdown of added protein by lysed lysosomes. 7. The intralysosomal pH has been estimated by comparing the rate of breakdown of endocytosed 125I-labelled albumin in intact lysosomes as a function of medium pH with that of added 125I-labelled albumin by lysed lysosomes at different pH values. The values obtained agree well with those calculated from the distribution of [14C]methylamine. 8. Methylamine and NH4Cl inhibit the breakdown of 125I-labelled albumin in intact lysosomes, particularly at high medium pH, but have no effect on the breakdown by lysed lysosomes. 9. It is concluded that a pH difference across the lysosomal membrane (more acidic inside than outside) is maintained by the presence of indiffusible negatively charged groups within the lysosomes, and by the permeation across the lysosomal membrane of protons together with permeant anions (or of OH- in exchange for anions).", "pmid": "9156", "mesh_set": "D000643 D000818 D002414 D004114 D004123 D006863 D008099 D008247 D008353 D008566 D008744 D011189 D011485 D051381 D012710 D013395", "score": 18.313015, "rank": 2919, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Ultimately PCS was proven to be present in only 3 patients, whereas 6 were discovered to be taking either laxatives or diuretics surreptitiously. In 2 of the 11 patients the cause of the diarrhea could not be determined. In PCS the major abnormality which we observed was that the jejunal mucosa secreted rather than absorbed when perfused with a plasma-like solution. By contrast, the ileum of the PCS patients absorbed a plasma-like solution in a normal fashion; however, one patient failed to absorb sodium and chloride when a solution with low (50 mM) sodium chloride concentration was perfused in the ileum. The volume of endogenous fluid was high in both the jejunum and ileum, presumably because of proximal small-intestinal secretion. Glucose stimulated sodium movement in an absorptive direction in each patient. Studies were repeated in one PCS patient after tumor removal, and his intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes was normal. Patients with diarrhea due to surreptitious ingestion of laxatives and diuretics showed normal absorption in the jejunum and ileum. This study shows that proximal small-bowel secretion was the major cause for diarrhea in our 3 patients with PCS. This cannot be a consequence of diarrhea per se since it was not found in patients with long-standing diarrhea due to surrepitious drug ingestion. Small-intestinal perfusion studies may be helpful in the diagnosis and management of selected cases of severe chronic diarrhea.

Hypotension was of 30 to 380 minutes duration and mean dosage of 12,44 mg (1,99 mug/kg/min). SCN- assays were performed by means of an original technique, which is described in this publication, before any perfusion of nitroprusside, every 30 minutes during perfusion and 30 and 60 minutes after ending the perfusion. Results show that SCN- concentration is increasing during perfusion but not as much as compared with the toxic concentration. Major increase takes place 30 minutes after starting the perfusion (1,27 10(-4) M/l). Increase slows down then and remains on a plateau level until the end of the perfusion where it decreases. Those results allow to reject a toxicity risk related to an increase of SCN- during nitroprusside perfusion.

Synthesis was back to normal after 24 hours. The ECS-treated rats did not show greater hyperactivity produced by the increased brain 5-HT accumulation following administration of L-tryptophan and tranylcypromine at any time up to 24 h later. This suggests that a single electroshock does not alter 5-HT functional activity. 3 Twenty-four hours after the final ECS of a series of 10 shocks given once daily, the rats were given tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan. They displayed greater hyperactivity than control rats not treated with ECS, suggesting that ECS increases 5-HT functional activity. Brain concentrations of 5-HT, 5-HIAA and tryptophan were then unchanged by ECS. 5-HT synthesis and accumulation of 5-HT following tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan were not altered by ECS. 4 The hyperactivity following administration of the 5-HT agonist 5-methoxy N,N-dimethyltryptamine was enhanced by repeated (10 day) ECS, suggesting altered post-synaptic responses to 5-HT receptor stimulation. 5 Repeated ECS enhanced locomotor activity following tranylcypromine and L-DOPA.

The activities of 30 different lysosomal enzymes were determined in vitro in the presence of the sulphated glycosaminoglycans, heparin and chondroitin sulphate, all the enzymes being measured on a density-gradient-purified lysosomal fraction. 2. Each enzyme was studied as a function of the pH of the incubation medium. In general the presence of sulphated glycosaminoglycans induced a strong pH-dependent inhibition of lysosomal enzymes at pH values lower than 5.0, with full activity at higher pH values. However, in the particular case of lysozyme and phospholipase A2 the heparin-induced inhibition was maintained in the pH range 4.0-7.0. 3. For certain enzymes, such as acid beta-glycerophosphatase, alpha-galactosidase, acid lipase, lysozyme and phospholipase A2, the pH-dependent behaviour obtained in the presence of heparin was quite different to that obtained with chondroitin sulphate, suggesting the existence of physicochemical characteristic factors playing a role in the intermolecular interaction for each of the sulphated glycosaminoglycans studied. 4. Except in the particular case of peroxidase activity, in all other lysosomal enzymes measured the glycosaminoglycan-enzyme complex formation was a temperature-and time-independent phenomenon. 5. The effects of the ionic strength and pH on this intermolecular interaction reinforce the concept of an electrostatic reversible interaction between anionic groups of the glycosaminoglycans and cationic groups on the enzyme molecule. 6. As leucocytic primary lysosomes have a very acid intragranular pH and large amounts of chondroitin sulphate, we propose that this glycosaminoglycan might act as molecular regulator of leucocytic activity, by inhibiting lysosomal enzymes when the intragranular pH is below the pI of lysosomal enzymes. This fact, plus the intravacuolar pH changes described during the phagocytic process, might explain the unresponsiveness of lysosomal enzymes against each other existing in primary lysosomes as well as its full activation at pH values occurring in secondary lysosomes during the phagocytic process.", "pmid": "12748", "mesh_set": "D000135 D002809 D006025 D006493 D006863 D006867 D007962 D008247 D009994 D013696 D013997", "score": 20.492334, "rank": 2070, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

When the drugs were administered individually, the antiviral activity was masked by the cytotoxic effect on the host. By combining the two drugs, it was possible to inhibit Japanese encephalitis virus production at noncytotoxic concentrations. The effects of 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 3-deazauridine on the growth inhibition of BHK-21 cells in cultures were only additive, while they were clearly synergistic on the inhibition of Japanese encephalitis virus production.

{"title": "Effect of uremia on nutritionally-induced variations in protein metabolism.", "abstract": "The effect of uremia on nutritionally-induced variations in protein metabolism was studied in growing rats with chronic, moderate uremia. Plasma and muscle protein synthetic activities and related values were measured from incorporation rates of 14C-leucine infused over a six-hour period. Synthetic activities were compared in the postabsorptive (2 to 14 hr after feeding) and in the fasting (18 to 24 hr after feeding) states. Differences between uremic and control rats were seen in fasting: plasma and intracellular leucine declined in control rats as fasting developed; they rose in uremic rats. In fasting uremic rats, a smaller percent of leucine efflux from extracellular fluid was used for protein synthesis. In a second study, muscle protein synthesis (Sm) and net urea nitrogen production (UNPr) were compared between control and uremic rats which were a) food-deprived but given carbohydrate for 36 hr, and b) fasted for 36 hr. Fasting, as contrasted with carbohydrate feeding, was associated with depressed muscle protein synthesis and increased UNPr in both control and uremic rats; the changes were greater in uremic rats. We conclude that food deprivation for more than 14 hr incurred greater catabolic responses of body protein in moderately uremic rats. The effect was mediated in part by greater suppression of muscle protein synthesis.

The dose-response curves obtained were compared with similar curves previously reported for sotalol, practolol, and atenolol with identical experimental methods. Two distinct types of response were identified: in the first, shown by propranolol and sotalol, increasing doses of the beta adrenoceptor-blocking drug continued to produce increasing effects to the limits of the dose levels examined; with the second (oxprenolol and practolol), increasing the dose initially resulted in substantial increase in effect but subsequently larger doses produced almost no increase in effect. Consideration of the additional properties of these beta adrenoceptor-blocking drugs revealed that both practolol and oxprenolol have intrinsic sympathomimetric activity (ISA), whereas propranolol and sotalol do not. In addition, practolol is cardioselective. Further investigation of the possible influence of ISA or cardioselectivity on beta adrenoceptor-blocking activity was undertaken by studying the effects of combinations of drugs on EHR. Sotalol produced greater effect when given 2 hr after sotalol, oxprenolol, practolol, or atenolol. When oxprenolol was given after sotalol or oxprenolol, or practolol was given after sotalol or practolol, there was no further increase in percentage reduction in EHR. When atenolol was given, the combinations of sotalol and atenolol together with two doses either of sotalol or atenolol all induced increases and similar final percentage reductions in EHR. Thus atenolol induces effects like those of sotalol, which are quite different from those of oxprenolol or practolol.

Treatment with methyl acetimidate was used to probe the topography of several tetrameric glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases, in particular the holoenzymes from rabbit muscle and Bacillus stearothermophilus. During the course of the reaction with the rabbit muscle enzyme, the number of amino groups fell rapidly from the starting value of 27 per subunit to a value of approx. five per subunit. This number could be lowered further to values between one and two per subunit by a second treatment with methyl acetimidate. The enzyme remained tetrameric throughout and retained 50% of its initial catalytic activity at the end of the experiment. 2. Use of methyl [1-14C]acetimidate and small-scale methods of protein chemistry showed that only one amino group per subunit, that of lysine-306, was completely unavailable for reaction with imido ester in the native enzyme. This results is consistent with the structure of the highly homologous glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of lobster muscle deduced from X-ray-crystallographic analysis, since lysine-306 can be seen to form an intrachain ion-pair with aspartic acid-241 in the hydrophobic environment of a subunit-subunit interface. 3. Several other amino groups in the rabbit muscle enzyme that reacted only slowly with the reagent were also identified chemically. These were found to be located entirely in the C-terminal half of the polypeptides chain, which comprises a folding domain associated with catalytic activity and subunit contact in the three-dimensional structure. Slow reaction of these 'surface' amino groups with methyl acetimidate is attributed to intramolecular ionic interactions of the amino groups with neighbouring side-chain carboxyl groups, a conclusion that is compatible with the reported three-dimensional structure and with the dependence of the reaction of ionic stength. 4. Very similar results were obtained with the enzymes from B. stearothermophilus and from ox muscle and ox liver, supporting the view that the ion-pair involving lysine-306 and aspartic acid-241 will be a common structural feature in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases. The B. stearothermophilus enzyme was fully active after modification. 5. No differences could be detected between the enzymes from ox muscle and ox liver, in accord with other evidence that points to the identify of these enzymes. 6.

The enzymes are aminopeptidases; no evidence for carboxypeptidase or endopeptidase activity was found. For hydrolysis, there appears to be an absolute requirement for an L-amino acid at the NH2-terminus of the peptide substrate. There was a similar but less absolute requirement for the penultimate NH2-terminal amino acid. Thus, although peptides of the type L-aminoacyl-L-proline, L-aminoacyl-L-prolyl-(L-amino acid)n, or L-aminoacyl-D-amino acid were not hydrolyzed, L-leucyl-beta-naphthylamide could be utilized as a substrate. The enzymes appeared to be metalloenzymes in that metal ion-chelating agents could inhibit their activities. Co2+ partially restored the activities lost by chelation.

The demographic, clinical, and morphological features were also correlated with anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibodies. The patients were divided in 2 groups: A, statin-exposed, and B, statin-unexposed.There was no significant association (P\u200a>\u200a.05) among anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP titers in relation to age, sex, statin exposure, and CK level. The concentrations of both antibodies were not correlated with symptoms, CK level, or statin exposure. Eleven (12.9%) patients had anti-HMGCR antibodies. We found a tendency (P\u200a=\u200a.051) toward greater anti-HMGCR positivity in women with no symptoms. Twelve (14.1%) patients had anti-SRP antibodies. There was no sex predominance, and only 1 patient had muscle complaints. Muscular symptoms were present in 31 (36.5%) patients, 4 (12.9%) were positive for anti-HMGCR antibodies, and 1 (3.2%) was positive for anti-SRP antibodies. A total of 54 (63.5%) patients had no muscle symptoms, 7 (13%) were anti-HMGCR positive, and 11 (20.4%) were anti-SRP positive. We found statistical significance for patients with anti-SRP antibodies when asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were compared (P\u200a=\u200a.029). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between symptoms and positivity for anti-HMG antibodies.One of the main aims of this study was to define a cutoff point in a heterogeneous population with different diagnoses. We also demonstrated that anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibodies are not 100% specific to immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy. We believe that these antibodies must be tested and interpreted within the specific context.", "pmid": "30170376", "mesh_set": "D001323 D001327 D003937 D004797 D005260 D006801 D006903 D019161 D008297 D008875 D018482 D009220 D009336 D012016 D012189 D012680 D018271", "score": 10.08673, "rank": 6047, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

These reactions were significantly inhibited when diphenhydramine, promethazine (antihistamines), chlorpromazine (antiserotonin), or cyproheptadine (antihistamine and antiserotonin) was given 30 min before endotoxin. Such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine or serotonin and peaked 1 hr after administration. The histamine-induced changes were inhibited by prior treatment with diphenhydramine. These reactions were also produced by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin, whereas no change was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of histamine or serotonin. These results indicate that histamine and serotonin released in mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the bone marrow reactions, which then continue in the presence of further mediators.

The drug in doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg deepened the decline of monosynaptic response amplitude evoked by trains of 10 stimuli to a motor nerve at 2, 5 or 10 Hz, without affecting the transmission of single isolated impulses. The patterns of decline were analyzed under the assumption that they reflect a partial depletion of the apparent transmitter stores in the presynaptic terminals, each incoming volley releasing a constant fraction of the store while a constant fraction of the instant size of the depleted part is being replenished per second. Ethosuximide increased the fractional release without a consistent effect on the fractional rate of replenishment.

{"title": "Quinidine pharmacokinetics in patients with cirrhosis or receiving propranolol.", "abstract": "Quinidine pharmacokinetics (half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance) as well as protein binding were evaluated following a single 200 mg. oral dose of quinidine sulfate in eight control patients, in eight patients with moderate to severe cirrhosis, and in seven patients receiving 40 to 400 mg./day of propranolol. Patients with cirrhosis had a significantly longer quinidine half-life (9 +/- 1 hr; p less than .01) when compared to control patients (6 +/- 0.5h). This was not related to a reduced quinidine clearance rate but rather to an increase in quinidine volume of distribution (4.1 +/- .4 L./Kg. in cirrhotic patients vs 2.6 +/- 1 L./Kg. in control patients; p less than .01). Abnormal quinidine binding (greater than 25 per cent unbound fraction) was noted in seven of the eight cirrhotic patients. In contrast, patients receiving propranolol had a normal quinidine half-life of 6 +/- 0.5 hr. However, these patients had a significantly reduced quinidine clearance (3.3 +/- .7 ml./min./Kg. vs. 5.3 +/- .5 ml./min./Kg. in controls; p less than .05) and higher peak concentrations (1.25 +/- .20 micrograms/ml. vs. .80 +/- .5 micrograms/ml. in controls; p less than .05). Therefore in patients receiving propranolol, quinidine levels may be higher than expected shortly after dosage, and therefore a potential for transient toxicity exists in these patients.

Temperature has a characteristic effect on the frequency of m.e.p.p.s at the frog neuromuscular junction; the spontaneous release of transmitter is not affected by temperature changes below 10 degrees C whereas the system is highly temperature-sensitive above 20 degrees C.2. A very similar result is obtained when the experiment is repeated in saline containing Ca(2+) buffered at 5 x 10(-7)M, suggesting that it is unlikely that the major action of temperature is to cause an increase in Ca(2+) influx.3. It is suggested that the main effect of temperature at the presynaptic terminals is a modification of [Ca(2+)](i) by an action on intracellular Ca(2+) stores.4. The interacting effects of theophylline and the divalent cation ionophore A23187 on m.e.p.p. frequency suggest that intracellular Ca(2+) stores, in addition to the mitochondria, may well be of importance in controlling [Ca(2+)](i).5. Changes in [Ca(2+)](o) produce a modification of m.e.p.p. frequency, but the details of the response are dependent on temperature. The spontaneous release of transmitter is most sensitive to an increase in [Ca(2+)](o) at 23 degrees C, whereas the greater effect is found at 13 degrees C when [Ca(2+)](o) is lowered.6. It is suggested (i) that m.e.p.p. frequency is primarily determined by [Ca(2+)](i) at the presynaptic terminals, (ii) that the presynaptic terminals are normally able to maintain [Ca(2+)](i) almost constant in spite of increases in Ca influx associated with ionophore treatment or with a rise in [Ca(2+)](o). However, if the steady-state position of [Ca(2+)](i) is previously raised by an increased efflux from intracellular stores (produced by elevated temperature or theophylline pre-treatment), increased influx causes a rise in both [Ca(2+)](i) and in m.e.p.p. frequency.", "pmid": "17743", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001001 D000001 D002118 D005110 D066298 D007424 D008564 D009469 D018377 D011896 D009435 D013696 D013806", "score": 22.059952, "rank": 1604, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The characteristics of absorption of individual amino acids from amino acid mixtures simulating casein and from enzymic hydrolysates of casein containing oligopeptides as well as free amino acids are known to be different. The differences, which are attributable to mucosal uptake of small peptides, involve more rapid absorption from the enzymic hydrolysates of certain amino acids which are relatively slowly absorbed from the amino acid mixtures. This could lead to more effective utilization of amino acids from the enzymic hydrolysates than from the amino acid mixtures. 2. To obtain further information bearing on this hypothesis, we have used a recently developed technique for portal cannulation in the guinea pig to make a preliminary investigation of amino acid concentrations in the portal venous plasma at intervals after the infusion into the duodenum of equivalent amounts of (a) an amino acid mixture simulating casein and (b) a partial enzymic (papain followed by kidney peptidases) hydrolysate of casein, the two preparations being infused in separate experiments. 3. For some amino acids, such as leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine and lysine, the curves after the enzymic hydrolysate were fairly similar to the corresponding curves after the amino acid mixture, though usually slightly lower. With other amino acids, the curves after the enzymic hydrolysate were very much lower than the corresponding curves after the amino acid mixture. With serine, glutamine, proline and glycine this discrepancy was particularly great. 4. The results cannot yet be fully explained, but their main features are explicable by the hypothesis that the lower amino acid concentrations in portal plasma after the enzymic hydrolysate are the result of entry of amino acids into the portal blood in peptide form, in which they would not be detectable by the analytical technique employed, and possibly also of more rapid clearance of amino acids from the blood during absorption of this preparation.", "pmid": "844257", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D002364 D005260 D005753 D006168 D007408 D011169 D011492", "score": 21.832989, "rank": 1650, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Propranolol-induced changes in blood pressure correlated also with associated changes in PRA (p less than 0.005); in contrast, no such relationship was observed with bufuralol.

A sigmoidal response of the ATPase activity to temperature is observed between 0 and 55 degrees C, with complete inactivation at 60 degrees C. The Arrhenius plot shows that the activation energy above the transition temperature (22 degrees C) (E(a)=144kJ/mol) is one-third of that calculated for below the transition temperature (E'(a)=408kJ/mol). 4.

The substrate for the outer-membrane ATPase is a bivalent metal ion-nucleoside triphosphate complex in which Mg(2+) (K(m)=50mum) can be replaced effectively by Ca(2+) (K(m)=6.7mum) or Mn(2+), and ATP by ITP.

The blocking effects were assayed through inhibition of the local GvHR after parental lymphocytes had been incubated with agents at suitable concentrations and then inoculated into F1 hybrid offspring. The intracellular effects were assessed beforehand by measuring the inhibition of [6-3H]thymidine incorporation by lymphocytes in the presence of a wide range of concentrations of agents. Concentration levels which induced no greater than approx. 50% inhibition of the [6-3H] thymidine incorporation were considered to reflect sufficiently small intracellular effects and were used for the subsequent GvHR comparisons. Cellular survival always was 90% or more for the GvHR tests (unless stated otherwise), even when inhibition of thymidine incorporation was as high as 50%; hence the thymidine data are useful not only as guides for dose levels in the GvHR but also as leads to new agents that may show immunosuppressive or anti-leukemic activity through intracellular effects. Structural specificity of the active compounds as cell-surface poisons is evidenced by little or no activity (less than 30% inhibition of GvHR) of 28 other disulfides, 2 trisulfides, 2 Bunte salts, and 8 other thiolsulfonates. Active agents may owe this function to replacement of the H of SH in cell-surface thiol receptors by an SR group. Glutathione did not significantly inactivate agents, probably because the products of reaction also are active disulfides. When two agents (III, IX) were given orally or intraperitoneally to F1 hybrid recipients of untreated parental cells, doses of 10--15 mg/kg produced a GvHR inhibition of 17--53%.", "pmid": "30542", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004220 D005260 D006087 D066298 D008214 D011817 D051381 D013329 D013438 D013451", "score": 21.141785, "rank": 1862, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "The buccal absorption of ascorbic acid and its passage through lipoid membrane.", "abstract": "Ascorbic acid concentration was measured in centrifuged and uncentrifuged saliva from normal young adult men and women. The salivary ascorbic acid content of uncentrifuged saliva was significantly higher in women on account of the ascorbic acid contained in the cellular sediment. Ascorbic acid absorption into the buccal mucosa was measured from solutions of pH range 3.4-9.0 held in the mouth for periods of 1-9 minutes. For a constant mouth contact time, increase in pH of the loading solutions resulted in reduction of buccal absorption, and diminishing transfer into the buccal epithelium. Percentage absorption was greater in males than females throughout the pH range. At pH 5, 80% of the loading solution was absorbed after 5 minutes. Diffusion of ascorbic acid through the lipoid membrane was more rapid in males. Female buccal cells had significantly higher ascorbic acid concentrations than male cells. Absorption of laevo and dextro ascorbic acid in human beings can be considered as partitioning into, or passage through, a lipoid phase into the buccal cells. The rate of passage of ascorbic acid into the buccal lining cells under controlled conditions of pH and buccal contact time is pH and concentration dependent in human beings.", "pmid": "18423", "mesh_set": "D000293 D000328 D001205 D002463 D005260 D006801 D006863 D008297 D009061 D012463 D012737", "score": 15.742519, "rank": 4202, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The responses of Aurelia medusae to pharmacological agents and ionic variation were classified into four response types: Type I, no response; Type II, inhibition of pacemaker activity; Type III, inhibition of both pacemakers and swimming muscles; and Type IV, increase in pacemaker output. 2. The swimming pacemakers of Aurelia medusae become hyperactive in Mg+2-free solutions (Type IV). This response appears to be general in swimming scyphozoa. 3. The response pattern to pharmacologically-active compounds indicates that the coelenterate neuromuscular system is quite different than those in other phyla. In fact, the response spectrum is not consistent within the Cnidaria. 4. Similarly, the responses of adult medusae to ionic variation show no consistent pattern within various scyphomedusae. 5. Test solutions from each response type established with medusae were selected and tested on the scyphistoma and strobila stages. The comparison of the responses to the test solutions between the medusa, scyphistoma, and strobila showed that the neuromuscular systems are physiologically different. The strobila, specificially the ephyra, is a mixture of both polypoid and medusoid response types.

The following four maleimide derivatives were used as thiol-directed reagents: N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), N-(4-methoxy-2-benzimidazolyl methyl) maleimide (MBM), N-(p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl)maleimide (BIPM) and N-(4-dimethyl-amino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide (DDPM). 1. All the maleimide derivatives used activated the Ca2+-ATPase activity and inhibited the EDTA-ATPase activity, like NEM, indicating that they modified S1. The rate of modification of S1 by NEM and BIPM increased with increasing pH, while that by DDPM decreased. BIPM simultaneously modified S1 and S2. 2. S1 showed much higher reactivity toward the maleimides, except for BIPM, than did N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac-Cys) a low molecular-weight model compound. The extremely small pKa value of S1, 6.28, accounted for this high reactivity. In addition, the ATP-induced increase in its reactivity inducated that S1 was in a buried state. Kinetic analysis showed that the teritiary structure around S1 at alkaline pH differed from that at acidic pH. 3. The apparent rate constant of S2-modification with NEM was approximately one seven-hundredth and one four-hundredth of those of S1 and N-Ac-Cys, respectively. Fluorimetric studies using BIPM revealed that S2 in the buried state was exposed upon adding ATP; this was compensated by the burying of some other thiol group(s) (Sp). Non-linearity of the Arrhenius plots of the reaction rate of S2 suggested that the S2 region of myosin had different conformations at high and low temperatures, the transition temperature being 10--15degrees. This non-linearity completely disappeared in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. On the other hand, Arrhenius plots for the thiols reactive to BIPM did not show non-linearity in the presence or absence of ATP.", "pmid": "9375", "mesh_set": "D000111 D000244 D000251 D000255 D001665 D002118 D006863 D007700 D008274 D008301 D009218 D011487 D013696", "score": 11.320779, "rank": 5901, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

R. H. Raetz and E. P. Kennedy, J. Biol. Chem. 248:1098--1105, 1973). The enzyme responsible for their synthesis, CTP:phosphatidic acid cytidylytransferase, was solubilized from the cell envelope by a differential extraction procedure involving the detergent digitonin and was purified about 70-fold (relative to cell-free extracts) in the presence of detergent. In studies of the heat stability of the enzyme, activity decayed slowly at 63 degrees C. Initial velocity kinetic experiments suggested a sequential, rather than ping-pong, reaction mechanism; isotopic exchange reaction studies supported this conclusion and indicated that inorganic pyrophosphate is released before CDP-diglyceride in the reaction sequence. The enzyme utilized both CTP and dCTP as nucleotide substrate for the synthesis of CDP-diglyceride and dCDP-diglyceride, respectively. No distinction was observed between CTP and dCTP utilization in any of the purification, heat stability, and reaction mechanism studies. In addition, CTP and dCTP were competitive substrates for the partially purified enzyme. It therefore appears that a single enzyme catalyzes synthesis of both CDP-diglyceride and dCDP-diglyceride in E. coli. The enzyme also catalyzes a pyrophosphorolysis of CDP-diglyceride, i.e., the reverse of its physiologically important catalysis.", "pmid": "30751", "mesh_set": "D002462 D003567 D003570 D003845 D004926 D006863 D007700 D009713 D013696", "score": 15.318927, "rank": 4433, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The phylogenetic analysis grouped isolates according to the predominant genotypes found in the Americas, and the in vitro characterization showed differences in the morphological changes induced by the isolates of each of the isolated serotypes compared to the reference serotypes. In vitro replicative capacity studies demonstrated that genomic copy number increased at four days post-infection and that cell viability decreased significantly compared to the control for all serotypes. The largest number of genomic copies in C6/36 was produced by DENV-2, followed by DENV-1 and DENV-4; DENV-3 produced the smallest number of genomic copies and had the smallest negative effect on cell viability. Finally, differences in the in vivo replication of intercolonial serotypes between the Rockefeller colony and the field colonies and among the intracolonial serotypes were found. The replication of DENV-2 at 7 and 14 days in both high- and low-incidence colonies was higher than that of the other serotypes, and replication of DENV-3 in the mosquito colonies was the most stable on the days evaluated.

The pH-dependence profile was found to be bell-shaped, the effect of transfer from the highest to the lowest values of the inactivation rate constants increasing more than 100 times. On the basis of the data obtained and published earlier it was concluded that the enzyme inactivation proceeded in accordance with the scheme in which out of 3 equilibrium ionic forms of penicillin amidase, i.e. \"acid\", \"neutral\" and \"alkaline\" the neutral form of the active enzyme was most stable. Kinetic analysis of the scheme was carried out and it was shown that the dependence found was in accordance with the theoretical curve in which the pK values of the ionogenic groups controlling the interconvertions between the penicillin amidase forms were equal to 2.4 and 10.1 at a temperature of 40 degrees C. The value of the inactivation rate constant of the \"acid\" or \"alkaline\" form was equal to 5.95 min-1, while the \"neutral\" form of the enzyme was characterized by the inactivation rate constant equal to 5.1.10(-4) min-1.

The present study investigates the possibility that the stimulatory effect of PRL in this preparation may be mediated through increased LH binding. Hamsters exposed to 5 h light per day for two months to induce gonadal atrophy were injected daily for 2 1/2 weeks with saline, 250 mug PRLP, 20 MUG LH+150 mug FSH, or PRL+LH+FSH. Short light control animals exhibited significantly less LH binding than controls on 14 h of light per day. Treatment with LH+FSH had no effect on LH binding while PRL alone or in combination with LH+FSH increased binding to levels greater than the long light controls. Peripheral testosterone concentrations reflected the level of LH binding. Scatchard analysis indicates that the decreased binding in the short-day animals is due to reduced LH receptor numbers and that PRL treatment elevates receptor levels thereby increasing LH binding.

The biosynthesis of juvenile hormone (JH) III by the corpora allata (CA) in female Cx. quiquefasciatus is sugar-dependent.

We investigated the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the early trypsin gene showing that JH III concentrations influence splicing. In the absence JH III the unspliced transcript is linked by a phosphoamide bond at the 5'-end to RNA ribonuleoprotein (RNP).

By this procedure the enzyme was purified 680-fold with a 31% yield. The sialyltransferase is originally associated with the high molecular weight particle also carrying the aggregation factor. In the last step the aggregation factor was separated from the sialyltransferase. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to the desialylated aggregation receptor. The molecular weight of the sialyltransferase has been determined to be 52,000. Kinetic studies revealed no lag phase and a dependence on enzyme concentration. The purified transferase has a pH optimum of 7.75 and requires 200 mM NaCl for activity. No requirement for Mg2+ or Ca2+ could be observed.

{"title": "Role of protein dissociation in the transport of acidic amino acids by the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell.", "abstract": "The pH profile for the uptake of L-glutamic acid by the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell arises largely as a sum of the decline with falling pH of a slow, Na+-dependent uptake by System A, and an increasing uptake by Na+-independent System L. The latter maximizes at about pH 4.5, following approximately the titration curve of the distal carboxyl group. This shift in route of uptake was verified by (a) a declining Na+-dependent component, (b) an almost corresponding decline in the 2-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid-inhibitable component, (c) a rising component inhibited by 2-aminonorbornane-2-carboxylic acid. Other amino acids recognized as principally reactive with Systems A or L yielded corresponding inhibitory effects with some conspicious exceptions: 2-Aminoisobutyric acid and even glycine become better substrates of System L as the pH is lowered; hence their inhibitory action on glutamic acid uptake is not lost. The above results were characterized by generally consistent relations among the half-saturation concentrations of the interacting amino acids with respect to: their own uptake, their inhibition of the uptake, one by another, and their trans stimulation of exodus, one by another. A small Na+-dependent component of uptake retained by L-glutamic acid but not by D-glutamic acid at pH 4.5 is inhibitable by methionine but by neither 2-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid nor the norbornane amino acid. We provisionally identified this component with System ASC, which transports L-glutamine throughout the pH range studied. No transport activity specific to the anionic amino acids was detected, and the unequivocally anionic cysteic acid showed neither significant mediated uptake nor inhibition of the uptake of glutamic aic or of the norbornane amino acid. The dicarboxylic amino acids take the sequence, aspartic acid less than glutamic acid less than alpha-aminoadipic acid less than S-carboxymethylcysteine, in their rate of mediated, Na+-independent uptake at low pH. Diiodotyrosine and two dissimilas isomers  of nitrotyrosine also show acceleration of uptake as the phenolate group on the sidechain is protonated, a result indicating that the acidic group need not be a carboxyl group and need not take a specific position in space to be accepted at the receptor site L. The presence of the carboxyl group does not upset the normal stereospecificity of System L until it falls on the beta-carbon in aspartic acid; even then it is the presence of the carbonyl group and not of the intact carboxyl group nor of its hydroxyl group that cancels out the stereospecificity, as was shown by the absence of normal stereospecificity for aspartic acid and asparagine and its presence in glutamic acid, homoserine and glutamine. In agreement, the uptak of aspartic acid is peculiarly sensitive to the presence of an alpha-methyl group or of other structures that modify the orientation of the sidechain.", "pmid": "12815", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000600 D000818 D001692 D002286 D005971 D006863 D007700 D008433 D051379", "score": 16.999475, "rank": 3569, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylation.", "abstract": "Certain characteristics of ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylation, as catalyzed by microsomes of liver, lung, and intestine of control and pretreated rats and hamsters, were studied. The results support previous suggestions that the reaction is catalyzed primarily by a 3-methyl-cholanthrene (MC)-inducible mono-oxygenase which has a 448-nm absorption maximum in the reduced-CO difference spectrum. Ethoxyresorufin exhibited a type I binding spectrum with liver microsomes from MC-induced rats, but there was no clear interaction with microsomes from control or phenobarbital (PB)-induced rats. Maximum MC-induction of type I binding and de-ethylase activity coincided with the appearance of a cytochrome P-450 spectrum whose absorption maximum was shifted to 448 nm. Low concentrations of alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) or benzo[a]pyrene (BP) inhibited the de-ethylation with liver microsomes of MC-treated rats (150 approximately 10(-9)M) but not those of control rats. A kinetic analysis of BP inhibition of this reaction showed it to be competitive. Inhibition of the MC-induced liver microsomal reaction by low concentrations of BP or ANF diminished rapidly with time. MC-induced rat liver microsomal de-ethylation of ethoxyresorufin was less sensitive than the PB-induced reaction to inhibition by metyrapone or SKF 525-A (I50 approximately 10(-6) - 10(-4)M). However, microsomes from rat liver, lung, and intestine had very low constitutive activities (less than 0.1 nmol/min/mg of protein). MC greatly induced the de-ethylation reaction in liver (200 X), intestine (40 X) and lung (10 X). De-ethylation of ethoxyresorufin in microsomes from control and MC-induced rat lung was inhibited by low concentrations of either ANF or BP (I50 approximately 10(-8) M). Control hamster liver microsomes were several times more active in de-ethylation than control rat liver microsomes, but MC-induction of hamster liver was only 1/10 of that in rat liver.

{"title": "Plasma protein synthesis by isolated rat hepatocytes.", "abstract": "A system of preparation of rat hepatocytes with extended viability has been developed to study the role of hormones and other plasma components upon secretory protein synthesis. Hepatocytes maintained in minimal essential medium reduced the levels of all amino acids in the medium except the slowly catabolized amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which steadily increase as the result of catabolism of liver protein. Although the liver cells catabolize 10-15% of their own protein during a 20-h incubation, the cells continue to secrete protein in a linear fashion throughout the period. The effects of insulin, cortisol, and epinephrine on general protein synthesis, and specifically on fibrinogen and albumin synthesis, have been tested on cells from both normal rats and adrenalectomized rats. Cells from normal animals show preinduction of tyrosine amino transferase (TAT), having at the time of isolation a high level of enzyme which shows only an increase of approximately 60% upon incubation with cortisol. In contrast, cells from adrenalectomized animals initially have a low level of enzyme which increases fourfold over a period of 9 h. The effects of both epinephrine and cortisol on protein synthesis are also much larger in cells from adrenalectomized animals. After a delay of several hours, cortisol increases fibrinogen synthesis sharply, so that at the end of the 20-h incubation, cells treated with hormone have secreted nearly 2.5 times as much fibrinogen as control cells. The effect is specific; cortisol stimulates neither albumin secretion nor intracellular protein synthesis.

Both antigens suppressed secondary anti-DNP RFC responses to DNP-KLH. Limiting doses of DNP-lys-S3 preferentially suppressed antibody-secreting cell levels, and had less effect on RFC. DNP-lys2.5-S3 was 500--1000-fold more potent in \"blockading\" primary RFC in vitro than DNP-lys0.6-S3, whereas both antigens were equally effective in blocking secondary RFC. These results suggest that the sensitivity of primed B lymphocytes to inactivation by DNP-lys-S3 is related to their high avidity for antigen. Furthermore, this appears to be largely due to a high density of immunoglobulin receptors on primed cells since the affinities of primary and secondary RFC for monovalent hapten were indistinguishable. Treatment of primarily immunized mice with DNP-lys2.5-S3 2 h before assay abolished 90% of RFC. Therefore, the reduction in RFC levels in tolerant mice may be due to cellular blockade by persisting tolerogen.

The interneuron somata also exhibited alterations over the postoperative period. There was a reversal of frequency of presynaptic boutons at 45 DPO. However unlike on alpha-motoneuron somata the frequency of S and F presynaptic boutons returned to normal at 60 and 90 DPO.

Animals were hemorrhaged to and maintained at 40 mmHg arterial blood pressure until they spontaneously took back 5% or 40% of the maximum bled volume. The phagocytic index, as determined by colloid clearance kinetics, was decreased in both groups following reinfusion of the shed blood. The reduction in phagocytic index was associated with decreased liver, unchanged spleen, and increased lung test colloid localization. Plasma opsonic activity, as determined by liver slice bioassay, was decreased 50-60% at 5% and 40% uptake of the maximum shed volume, decreased further 15 min after reinfusion in both groups, and tended to recover 1 h after reinfusion in the 5% uptake group. In vitro hepatic phagocytic activity of liver slices from shocked animals in the presence of normal rat plasma was decreased only in the 40% uptake animals after reinfusion when the arterial blood pressure had decreased to 50 mmHg.

{"title": "Oxygen transport impairment in diabetes.", "abstract": "Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves (ODC) from zero to full saturation were developed from tests performed on whole blood from various groups of diabetic and nondiabetic healthy subjects. P50 at in-vivo pH was slightly but significantly lower than normal in ambulatory nonacidotic, uncomplicated juvenile diabetics (26.0 vs. 27.3 mm. Hg, P less than 0.001), despite increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentrations in diabetic erythrocytes (15.0 vs. 13.7 mumole/gm. Hb, P less than 0.001). This combination of changes is in keeping with the presence of increased proportions of hemoglobin AIc in insulin-treated diabetics. The position of the ODC was positively correlated with the 2,3-DPG concentration (P less than 0.01), which varied in response to fluctuations in plasma concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi) (P less than 0.001). Optimal metabolic control may lead to a normalization of the ODC in association with increased concentrations of red cell 2,3-DPG and P. When the diabetes was uncontrolled, the ODC was usually unchanged during the acidotic phase because the lowered pH balanced the effect of diminished 2,3-DPG concentration on the ODC. After correction of acidosis, the disproportion between erythrocyte 2,3-DPG and pH became quite prominent, accompanied by a corresponding fall in P50 (21.0 vs. 26.1 mm. Hg, P less than 0.001). Following ketoacidosis, with a persistently lowered Pi, it may take up to one week for 2,3-DPG to return to an approximately normal level, and the P50 will be impaired for the same period. A diphosphonate (EHDP) known to enhance tubular phosphate reabsorption in man was given to nonacidotic insulin-treated diabetic and healthy volunteers for 28 days. It caused a significant increase in mean Pi and P50 in both healthy and diabetic subjects (r = 0.58, P less than 0.01). When a dietary supplement of dibasic calcium phosphate was given to diabetic subjects for 28 days, a significant increase in P50 also occurred (25.2 vs. 27.2 mm. Hg, P less than 0.001). It is recommended that the diabetes diet be supplemented by dibasic calcium phosphate to prevent the inhibitory effect of a low concentration of Pi on red cell oxygen delivery.", "pmid": "9322", "mesh_set": "D001693 D001786 D002130 D002648 D003920 D003922 D016883 D003930 D004163 D004912 D006400 D006454 D006801 D006863 D000860 D008833 D010100 D010108 D010313 D010710", "score": 12.550847, "rank": 5601, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Following a 5-day recovery period, fetal blood samples (10 ml/48 h) were taken and the steroid sulphate fraction analysed as trimethylsilyl esters by gas-liquid chromatography (g. l.c.). Three progestagen metabolites were repeatedly detected in plasma samples from control and nephrectomized fetuses and identified by g.l.c.-mass-spectrometric techniques as 5 beta-pregnane-3 beta,20 beta-diol, 5 beta-pregnane-3 beta,20 alpha-diol and 5 beta-pregnane-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol. In three control fetuses the plasma concentration of both 5 beta-pregnane-3 beta,20 beta-diol and -20 alpha-diol showed a steady increase from about 0.5 micrograms/ml at 105 days to about 1.5 and 2-2.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, at 143 days gestation. A study in one fetus indicated that the values then fell precipitously by term (147 days) as plasma cortisol concentrations rose. In contrast, whilst no consistent patterns were seen in their concentration in five nephrectomized fetuses the levels were 2-10 times higher than the control values (0.5-10 micrograms/ml) at all stages. The plasma concentration of 5 beta-pregnane-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol was less perturbed by nephrectomy and only showed a slight increase over control values (0.2-0.5 micrograms/ml). Three sham-operated fetuses which aborted following infection also showed increased plasma concentrations of 5 beta-pregnane-3 beta,20 beta-diol and -20 alpha-diol, similar to the nephrectomized fetuses.

All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of membrane conductance. Furthermore, membrane polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP. All these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids. When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and glycine. Topically applied strychnine and picrotoxin induced different changes of post-synaptic potentials, indicating that distinct inhibitory systems might be influenced by these two convulsants. Interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of GABA, while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine, glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. But differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected: the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine.

Wanted effects include: (1) the attainment of adequate drug concentrations for the minimum period of time necessary, as in the use of antibiotics; (2) the suppression of symptoms, as in the use of the benzodiazepines in anxiety states; (3) the use of drugs to improve function, e.g. levodopa in Parkinsonism; (4) drugs are used to prevent episodes of illness; and (5) complex suppression of symptoms, as with the antidepressives and antipsychotics. The biological alternatives to plasma level monitoring depend on establishing an empirical relationship between the putative monitor and the clinical response.

{"title": "Model studies of intracellular acid-base temperature responses in ectotherms.", "abstract": "Measurements of intracellular pH (pHi) in air-breathing ectotherms have only been made in the steady state; these pHi indicate that protein charge state, measured as alpha imidazole (alphaIM), the fractional dissociation of protein histidine imidazole groups, is preserved when ectotherm tissues change temperature in vivo, with related changes in pHi and PCO2. In partial answer to the question of how such tissues are able to avoid disrupting transients to functions sensitive to protein charge states, model studies were carried out to assess the passive intracellular buffer system response to a combined change in body temperature and CO2 partial pressure as occurs in vivo in these species. The cell compartment was modeled as a closed volume of ternary buffer solution, containing protein imidazole (50 mM/1); phosphate (15 mM/1) and CO2-bicarbonate buffer components, permeable only to CO2 and permitted no change in buffer base. Excursions from a steady-state non-equilibrium pHi were computed to a step-change in temperature/PCO2. Computations for frog (Rana catesbeiana) striated muscle show that the calculated pHi response on the basis of estimated composition and concentration of cell buffer components, moves along the curve describing the steady-state temperature relationship. No transient away from steady-state alphaIM and carbon dioxide content need be postulated. Applications to turtle (Pseudemys scripta) striated muscle are also explored.

In contrast phentolamine was a competitive antagonist at alpha-adrenoreceptors only, and propranolol a competitive antagonist at beta-adrenoreceptors only. Labetalol was 6-10 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoreceptors and 1.5-3 times less potent than propranolol in blocking beta-adrenoreceptors. Labetalol itself was 4-8 times more potent at beta- than at alpha-adrenoreceptors. 3 In anaesthetized dogs labetalol given intravenously blocked vasopressor responses to phenylephrine positive chronotropic, vasodepressor and bronchodilator response to isoprenaline. Phentolamine blocked the effect of phenylephrine only, and propranolol the effects of isoprenaline only. Labetalol was about 7 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoreceptors, about 4 times less potent than propranolol in blocking cardiac beta1-adrenoreceptors, and 11-17 times less potent than propranolol in blocking vascular and bronchial beta2-adrenoceptors. This difference in the relative potency of labetalol arises because propranolol is a slightly more potent antagonist at beta2- than at beta1-adrenoreceptors. Labetaol itself was about 16 times more potent at cardiac beta1- than at vascular alpha-adrenoreceptors. In conscious dogs labetaol given orally blocked vasopressor responses to phenylephrine and positive chonotropic responses to isoprenaline. 4 In anesthetized dogs and pithed rats labetaol blocked alpha- or beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and intravenously administered phenylephrine or isoprenaline to approximately the same extent. 5 Labetalol does not possess partial agonist (intrinsic sympathomimetic) activity at cardiac beta1-adrenoreceptors. 6 The blocking action of labetalol both in vivo was shown to be specific for alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors. 7 The haemodynamic effects of labetalol are attributable to its adrenoreceptor-blocking actions. The observed responses vary from one experiment situation to another depending on the balance of autonomic influences. For example, in barbitone-anaesthetized dogs, in which sympathetic tone predominates, both labetalol and propranolol reduced heart rate, contractility, output and work--effects which are attributable to beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. Labetalol differed from propranolol in decreasing rather than increasing total peripheral resistance and in causing larger falls in blood pressure at equipotent beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking doses.

Glucagon and C-peptide assays showed that the pancreatic alpha cells were stimulated by fructose and that the beta cells did not respond to fructose. It is not known whether the latter was due to his diabetes or to the lack of a beta cell response to this sugar. Primed 14C-glucose infusions were used for the first time to study nonsteady state glucose kinetics in man. They showed that, 24 hours after the last insulin injection and under basal conditions, the glucose concentrations increased because glucose production exceeded glucose utilization. However, after the administration of sorbitol the plasma glucose concentration decreased because glucose production decreased. After the administration of sorbitol there was no change in the metabolic clearance of glucose. This reflects the lack of a peripheral insulin effect and is consistent with the lack of any measurable C-peptide. Glucose utilization also decreased, but this decrease was less than the decrease in glucose production. Because the metabolic clearance of glucose remained unchanged, it was concluded that the change in glucose utilization was solely due to the decrease in glucose concentration. The absence of C-peptide in the plasma indicated that changes in glucose turnover were not related to any changes in endogenous plasma insulin. Furthermore, the plasma glucagon concentration increased and, hence, changes in this hormone could not account for the decrease in glucose production. Therefore, it was concluded that the sorbitol-induced decline in glucose production was due to a direct effect on hepatic metabolism.", "pmid": "13654", "mesh_set": "D000284 D002239 D048909 D005632 D005633 D005947 D006801 D006863 D006949 D007263 D007515 D007668 D007669 D007700 D008297 D008875 D010179 D013012 D014280 D014556", "score": 13.471332, "rank": 5273, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Thin muscle bundles were washed in Tris chloride and Tris propionate solutions containing 6 mM K. The current strength was always 5 x 10-9 A and the steady-state membrane voltage was about 5 mV. The average chloride conductance (gcl, in mumho/cm2) of normal muscles was 845 (G) and 1,025 (S). The potassium conductance (gk) was 99 (G) and 161 (s). In separate measurements, the contribution of the chloride conductance (gcl) to the total membrane conductance (gm) was 89% for normal G and S. Two weeks after denervation the average gcl decreased to 440 in G and 191 in S; gk increased to 205 in G and to 364 in S in the presence of 0.1 mM Ca in solution; the increase in gk was less when measurements were made in the presence of 3mM Ca and 1 mM Mg.

Specific behaviour towards delta-chymotrypsin.", "abstract": "When N-[14C] acetylbenzotriazole, presented here as a new agent for the acetylation of proteins, reacted at pH 8 and 25 degrees C with delta-chymotrypsin, 15 amino groups (the epsilon-amino groups of lysing residues and the alpha-amino terminus of half-cystine-1) and two phenolic groups (those of the two exposed tyrosine residues) were acetylated with respective pseudo first-order constants of 0.056 +/- 0.003 and 0.15 +/- 0.03 min(-1). Surprisingly, in contrast with the acetic anhydride reaction, the alpha-amino group of Ile-16 was found to be not acetylated as shown by N-terminus determination and activity measurements: the modified delta-chymotrypsin (or acetylated delta-chymotrypsin) was fully active after neutral dialysis. Only a transient inactivation due to the incorporation of one [14C] acetyl group per mole of catalytic site was observed. The kinetic constant found for reactivation at pH 8.5 was 0.315 +/- 0.005 min(-1) at 25 degrees C. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetylbenzotriazole was described by a k(cat) value of 0.093 +/- 0.005 min(-1) at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. Circular dichroism changes observed at 230 nm during the reaction at pH 8.5, of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin with N-acetylbenzotriazole indicated a total conversion of the amount of enzyme molecules which were in the 'inactive' or 'alkaline' conformation at this pH, into the 'active' or 'neutral' one. Benzotriazole alone was unable to induce such a conformational change. The rate constant of the reverse structural process from the 'neutral' to the 'alkaline' conformation was 0.32 +/- 0.02 min(-1): identical to that of the deacetylation of the catalytic site. Thus, the unusual lack of acetylation of Ile-16 alpha-amino group during delta-chymotrypsin treatment with N-acetylbenzotriazole is interpreted as a stabilization of the enzyme 'neutral' conformation where the Ile-16 alpha-amino group is buried, thus inaccessible to the reagent. The properties of the delta-chymotrypsin modification using N-acetylbenzotriazole led to practical uses: direct spectrophotometric titration of chymotrypsin operational normality at pH 7 and rapid preparation of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin. As a protein reagent, N-acetylbenzotriazole is particularly interesting because of its reactivity towards amino and phenolic groups of amino acid residues, its stability at acid pH, i.e., k(hydrolysis=7.38 X 10(-3) min(-1) at 25 degrees C [Ravaux et al.

Part of the release was due to the increase in pH of the reaction mixture with cooling. Calcium release was greatly reduced or completely prevented by the inclusion of oxalate or inorganic orthophosphate in the medium. No release occurred in 5 mM oxalate. With phosphate, the proportion of the calcium previously taken up at 23 degrees C that was released at 0 degrees C became progressively smaller as the phosphate concentration was increased. When the pH was adjusted to be the same at 0 degrees C as at 23 degrees C there was little release from white muscle preparations in 10 mM phosphate and no release when the phosphate concentration was 20 mM or more. With red muscle preparations calcium was released at higher phosphate concentrations, 8% of the amount previously taken up still being released at 50 mM phosphate and a smaller amount at 100 mM phosphate.

In 43 patients pneumoconiosis had attained the stage of progressive massive fibrosis. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 78 months, except in 8 patients who died before the twenty-fourth month. Twenty-seven of the 59 patients were treated for the first time, and 32 were in retreatment. In none of them had rifampin been administered before. Although the objective was to administer rifampin in combination with one, 2, or even 3 companion drugs that had not been administered before and that had proved to be active on the patients' bacilli in vitro, this goal was fully reached only in the first treatment group; in 8 of the 32 retreated patients the drugs combined with rifampin were considered ineffective. The speed and rate of bacteriologic conversion were most impressive. Sputum conversion was obtained in 90 per cent of the patients; in the initial treatment group 100 per cent of the patients converted their sputum on culture at 5 months and in the retreatment group the corresponding figure was 84.4 per cent. These bacteriologic results are nearly as favorable as those obtained in cases of advanced pulmonary tuberculosis without pneumoconiosis treated with the same rifampin-containing drug regimens. It was concluded that rifampin-combined chemotherapy largely eliminates the handicap caused by the coexistence of tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis. Side effects due to rifampin were without practical significance. In 3 patients of 57 treated with ethambutol, visual impairment was observed.

{"title": "The effects of dopamine on human platelet aggregation, in vitro.", "abstract": "An unexpected inhibition of human platelet aggregation by dopamine -- the precursor of epinephrine and norepinephrine -- is presented. Human platelet-rich plasma was incubated in an aggregometer for 120 seconds at 37 degrees C, with either dopamine or saline control. Adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine or collagen was added as the aggregating agent. Dopamine inhibits induction of platelet aggregation by all three agents and causes platelet disaggregation. At low doses (400 mug/ml or less), dopamine induces platelet aggregation and enhances ADP-induced aggregation. In addition, a concentration of dopamine of 40 mug/ml induces aggregation, enhances ADP-induced aggregation and inhibits epinephrine aggregation. Phentolamine is able to block dopamine enhancement of ADP aggregation, but propranolol and haloperidol fail to prevent dopamine inhibition of epinephrine aggregation. These observations are explained neither by the currently known intracellular actions of dopamine which involve competition with serotonin nor by a single mediator such as cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate.

{"title": "Transport and utilization of the biosynthetic intermediate shikimic acid in Escherichia coli.", "abstract": "Auxotrophic mutants of Escherichia coli W or K12 blocked before shikimic acid in the aromatic biosynthetic pathway grew poorly on shikimic acid as sole aromatic supplement. This poor growth response was correlated with a relatively poor ability to transport shikimic acid. If citrate was present in the growth medium (as it is in some commonly used basal media) the growth of some of the E. coli K12 mutants on shikimate was further reduced. Mutants were derived from pre-shikimate auxotrophs which grew rapidly on media containing shikimic acid. These derivatives all had an increased ability to transport shikimic acid. Thus, it is proposed that the growth on shikimate observed in the parent cells is restricted by their relatively poor uptake of shikimate from the medium and that this restriction may be removed by a mutation which enhances shikimate transport. Transduction analysis of the mutations which enhanced utilization and transport of shikimic acid by E. coli K12 strains indicated at least two classes. Class 1 was about 20% cotransduced with the histidine region of the E. coli K12 chromosome and appeared to be coincident with a known shikimate transport locus, shiA. Class 2 was not cotransduced with his. The locus (or loci) of this class is unknown. Kinetic measurements suggested that both classes had shikimate uptake systems derived from the wild-type system.

{"title": "Central nervous system pH in uremia and the effects of hemodialysis.", "abstract": "Rapid hemodialysis of uremic animals may induce a syndrome characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, grand mal seizures, and electroencephalographic abnormalities. There is a fall in pH and bicarbonate concentration in CSF, and brain osmolality exceeds that of plasma, resulting in a net movement of water into the brain. This syndrome has been called experimental dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. The fall in pH of CSF may be secondary to a fall of intracellular pH (pHi) in brain. Since changes in pHi can alter intracellular osmolality in other tissues, it was decided to investigate brain pHi in uremia, and the effects of hemodialysis. Brain pHi was measured by evaluating the distribution of 14C-labeled dimethadione in brain relative to CSF, while extracellular space was calculated as the 35504=/4 space relative to CSF. In animals with acute renal failure, brain (cerebral cortex) pHi was 7.06+/-0.02 (+/-SE) while that in CSF was 7.31+/-0.02, both values not different from normal. After rapid hemodialysis (100 min) of uremic animals, plasma creatinine fell from 11.8 to 5.9 mg/dl. Brain pHi was 6.89+/-0.02 and CSF pH and 7.19+/-0.02, both values significantly lower than in uremic animals (P less than 0.01), and there was a 12% increase in brain water content. After slow hemodialysis (210 min), brain pHi (7.01+/-0.02) and pH in CSF (7.27+/-0.02) were both significantly greater than values observed after rapid hemodialysis (P less than 0.01), and brain water content was normal. None of the above maneuvers had any effect on pHi of skeletal muscle or subcortical white matter. The data show that rapid hemodialysis of uremic dogs is accompanied by a significant fall in pH of CSF and pHi in cerebral cortex. Accompanying the fall in brain pHi is cerebral edema.", "pmid": "8469", "mesh_set": "D000137 D000818 D001921 D002555 D004285 D005260 D006863 D008297 D009994 D006435 D014511", "score": 31.789877, "rank": 394, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

It is a common clinical experience to find that a fair proportion of patients fail to show a satisfactory response and that others complain of side-effects. Important factors which influence this situation are the diagnostic criteria used to select patients for drug treatment, the dosage prescribed and individual compliance. Measurement of plasma drug concentrations has been proposed as a more rational way of increasing the efficacy of antidepressant medication and avoiding toxicity. A number of studies have shown a correlation between plasma concentrations of these drugs and clinical effects, but the relationship is far from simple. With amitriptyline and nortriptyline there is good evidence for a 'therapeutic window' within which maximum antidepressant action is obtained. Many patients being treated with these drugs have plasma levels outside recommended therapeutic ranges. Experience in our department has shown that there are a number of clinical situations where routine plasma level monitoring of selected antidepressants is of value: (1) inadequate clinical response; (2) side-effects/toxicity; (3) complicating medical conditions; (4) suspected poor compliance; and (5) long-term therapy.

All compounds at concentrations between 10 and 50 mM display a strong sensitizing effect in the presence of oxygen (DMF between 0-1 and 0-3) and are much less effective in nitrogen. In N2O the degree of sensitization is intermediate between oxygen and nitrogen. The situation is the same at pH 7 or 5-6. Solutions of DA, ITA and IP irradiated at pH lower than 6 become highly toxic to bacteria added after irradiation, for several hours after X-irradiation or several minutes after pulsed irradiation. The maximum toxic effect occurs with 2 krad of X-ray and with 6-8 krad of electrons. Oxygen must be present in order to observe the bactericidal activity. This is not affected by scavenging hydrated electrons with nitrate, but is completely cancelled by scavenging OH radicals with formate. It is also cancelled by adding thiosulphate to the irradiated solutions immediately before the bacteria. In the presence of nutrient broth, the radiosensitizing effect is absent after irradiation with pulsed electrons; whereas after X-irradiation it is reduced when the concentration of sensitizers is 50 mM. The experimental data appear to be compatible with a mechanism operated by short and long-lived transients resulting from the radiolysis of iodinated contrast media.", "pmid": "14900", "mesh_set": "D002470 D004307 D004926 D006863 D007202 D007455 D008722 D011836", "score": 19.220867, "rank": 2552, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Effect of sodium fluoride on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the rat uterus.", "abstract": "Intrauterine administration of 50 mumol of NaF to the ovariectomized mature rat causes a 2--3-fold increase in the total uterine glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity within 24 h. The response is characterized by a 4--6 h lag with a maximum effect from 24 to 36 h after a single treatment. Uterine glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity continues to increase with daily administration of NaF through 4 days. The NaF-induced response is blocked by prior intrauterine administration of cycloheximide but not actinomycin D suggesting that the enzyme activity increases by a post-transcriptional effect of NaF on de novo enzyme synthesis. Direct measurement of the effect of NaF on the rate of incorporation of [14C] leucine into immunoprecipitable uterine glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase indicates that NaF causes a 9-fold increase in the rate of enzyme synthesis during the interval from 12 to 16 h after treatment. The half-life of the enzyme as measured by the rate of loss of [1-14C] glutamate from previously labeled utreine glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is decreased  from 27 to 10 h by NaF. The NaF response does not seem to be mediated by activation of uterine adenylyl cyclase since theophylline does not potentiate the response and since intrauterine application of cyclic AMP does not mimic the response. The increase in enzyme activity is preceded by an increase in the rate of utilization of the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway as determined by the ratio of the the rates of oxidation of [1-14C]glucose to [6-14C] glucose to CO2 by uterine slices in vitro. The action of NaF on this pathway most likely resutls from inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme, enolase, and increased pathway utilization may be the factor which controls enzyme synthesis.

The decrease in temperature alone had very little effect on these parameters. However, in the forward reaction, 30% methanol resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the Km value for glutamate, a slight decrease in the Km value for NADP, and a thirty-fold decrease in Vm. Substrate inhibition by glutamate was observed at concentrations greater than 4 mM. In the reverse reaction, 30% methanol caused a decrease in the Km values for alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia and a 10-fold decrease in Vm. Substrate inhibition by both alpha-ketoglutarate and NADPH was observed at concentrations of either substrate above 0.03 mM. The dependence of Km for glutamate and Vm values for the forward reaction on methanol concentration suggests that they are similarly affected by methanol, in direct contrast to results obtained for NADP. Methanol appeared to cause a general tightening of complexes, which may arise from an effect on the \"activities\" of species in solution. The use of methanol not only allows for the study of reaction intermediates by slowing the reaction with the cryogenic method, but may also serve as a mechanistic probe by affecting several polarity as well as Km, Vm, and K1 values.", "pmid": "262405", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002417 D005615 D005969 D007700 D008099 D000432", "score": 15.163587, "rank": 4522, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Effect of beta adrenergic blockade on renin response to renal nerve stimulation.", "abstract": "The ability of d,l-propranolol to block renin secretion in response to various extrarenal stimuli, such as hemorrhage and hypoglycemia, has been interpreted to indicate the presence of an intrarenal beta receptor regulating renin release. However, two problems complicate this interpretation: (a) the stimuli have effects outside the kidney, and (b) d,l-propranolol has a local anesthetic, as well as a beta adrenergic blocking, action. In the present study, the effects of a purely intrarenal stimulus, in the form of renal nerve stimulation (RNS), on renin secretion was examined. The effects of d,l-propranolol (anesthetic and beta-blocking activity), l-propranolol (beta-blocking activity only), and d-propranolol (local anesthetic activity only) on the renin response to RNS were examined. In a control group of animals, two sequential RNS increased mean renin secretion from 401 to 1,255 U/min (P less than 0.25) and from 220 to 2,179 U/min (P less than 0.01). In a second group the first RNS increased renin secretion from 201 to 1,181 U/min (P less than 0.01), but after d,l-propranolol was given RNS did not significantly alter renin secretion (33 to 55 U/min). In a third group the initial RNS increased renin secretion from 378 to 1,802 U/min (P less than 0.025), but after l-propranolol was given RNS had no significant effect on renin secretion (84 to 51 U/min). A fourth group of dogs showed a rise in renin secretion from 205 to 880 U/min (P less than 0.001) in response to the first RNS, while the second RNS, given after an infusion of d-propranolol, caused a rise in renin secretion from 80 to 482 (P less than 0.005). The nature of the electrical stimulus was consistent in all groups and caused no detectable changes in renal or systemic hemodynamics or in urinary electrolyte excretion. The results, therefore, indicate that renin secretion can be stimulated through intrarenal beta receptors independent of changes in systemic or renal hemodynamics or in tubular sodium reabsorption. Hence the effect of beta stimulation on renin secretion would appear to result from a direct action on the renin-secreting cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.", "pmid": "3519", "mesh_set": "D000319 D000818 D004285 D007668 D008297 D011188 D011433 D012039 D012083 D012964 D013153 D013268 D014655", "score": 11.758005, "rank": 5822, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

This coenzyme derivative adds stoichiometrically to the apotransaminase as observed by both fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. The fluorinated phosphypyridoxamine derivative, when bound to the apotransaminase, will not dissociate upon extensive dialysis or passage through Sephadex G-25. The compound behaves as a pyridoxamine phosphate derivative and not as a coenzyme-substrate complex, since both competing anions and dicarboxylic acid inhibitors still bind to the phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine enzyme. The 19F NMR spectra of the enzyme-bound phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine were measured as a function of pH, ionic strength, and temperature. The 19F MNR of the enzyme-bound coenzyme derivative revealed no predetermined asymmetry in the subunits of aspartate transaminase insolution in terms of differences in chemical shift or resonance line shape between the two environments. A pH-dependent chemical shift change of the single 19F resonance was observed, which is consistent with the influence of a single ionization with an apparent pKa of 8.4 in 0.10 M KCl at 30 degrees.

There was a strong positive correlation between plasma vitamin C and buffy-coat vititamin C. 3. There were not significant correlations between plasma or buffy-coat vitamin CPAMIN C. 3. There were not significant correlations between plasma or buffy-coat vitamin C and total urinary hydroxyproline, whether expressed on a creatinine basis or on a total amino acid basis. Similarly, no significant correlations could be detected involving the proline/hydroxyproline ratio in urine hydrolysates. 4. There was a significant negative correlation between plasma or buffy-coat vitamin C and total urinary proline, when expressed per unit of total urinary proline, when expressed per unit of total urinary proline, when expressed per unit of total amino acids in the hydrolysates. This correlation was not observed with unhydrolysed urine, and it appeared to reside in the diffusible fraction, part of whose proline could be liberated by prolidase digestion. In addition, in the man, there was some evidence for a positive correlation between plasma or buffy-coat vitamin C and the ratio of total urinary amino acids to creatinine. 5. These results support the view that poor vitamin C status in elderly humans may be associated with a defect in collagen proline hydroxylation, reflected by increased excretion of proline-rich, collagen-derived peptides. If this interpretation is correct, it indicates a potential defect in connective tissue repair, and could form the basis of a functional test for subclinical vitamin C deficiency.", "pmid": "862347", "mesh_set": "D000368 D001205 D001206 D003404 D005260 D006801 D006909 D008297 D011392", "score": 12.351608, "rank": 5670, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The activities ofth ese compounds are ranked 20:2.5:1. The log dose-response curves constructed for inhibiton of FS-4 cell RNA synthesis show similar slopes and a leveling off at 60-70% inhibition of RNA synthesis at the highest concentrations of each compound tested. This evidence suggests that these three derivatives act through the same mechanism. It has been shown previously that the dichloro compound selectively inhibits nuclear heterogenous RNA and messenger RNA synthesis. The concentrations of the benzimidazole ribosides at which the rate of proliferation of human fibroblasts (FS-4) is reduced by 50% are as follows: monobromodichloro: 1.7 muM (0.68 mug/ml); dibromo: 12 muM (4.9 mug/ml); dichloro: 38 muM (12 mug/ml). All compounds reduce the exponential rate of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of cell growth is reversible upon removal of the compounds from the medium. Protocols based on any one of the three halobenzimidazole ribosides give interferon yields from poly(I)-poly(C)-induced FS-4 cells which are comparable to the high yields obtained with the conventional cycloheximide-actinomycin D protocol.

The short toe extensor muscle consisted of type I and type II muscle fibres in about equal proportion. In some subjects there was type-grouping so that recordings with sufficient selectivity could easily be obtained. 3. Certain motor units could be driven continuously, attained regular firing intervals even at a firing rate of 10/sec, increased slowly in firing rate with increase in contraction strength, had maximum firing rate below 30/sec during sustained contraction but above 60/sec in twitch contraction. 4. Other motor units could not be dirven continuously, did not fire repeatedly at rates below 20/sec, increased rapidly in firing rate with increase in contraction strength and attained firing rates above 100/sec. 5. There were intermediate forms between continuously firing low frequency motor units and intermittently firing high frequency motor units. 6. In a prolonged contraction of constant strength only continuously firing motor units were active. 7. On rapid accelerations, however, both continuously and intermittently firing motor units were active and played about the same role. 8. This applied also to prolonged series of accelerations as in rhythmically alternating movements. 9. In twitch contractions selective activation of intermittently firing motor units occurred if the muscle was relaxed prior to the twitch and great effort was used to elicit the twitch and minimum duration of the twitch was intended. 10.

Pelleted diets containing concentrates and 0, 200, 400 or 600 g chopped straw/kg were fed ad lib, for 5 h daily to four cows. Concentrations of various energy-yielding metabolites were measured in samples of rumen fluid and jugular blood taken before feeding and at intervals after food was offered. 2. After feeding, the pH of rumen fluid decreased rapidly and the total concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased; the changes were greatest in the diet containing no roughage. The changes were essentially complete by 135 min at approximately the time feeding stopped. Rumen lactate concentrations were always low and increased significantly only in cows given no roughage. 3. There were highly significant relationships between the peak rumen acetate concentration after a meal and the apparent digestibility of the dry matter of that meal, and the amount of material in the rumen at the end of a meal. The latter relationship resulted in there being no difference between treatments in the total amount of acetate present in the rumen after feeding. 4. In the blood, concentrations of acetate, propionate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and lactate all increased after feeding. The increase was prolonged and maximum values were rarely reached before 4-5 h. The highest concentrations of acetate and BHB were found in cows given 20 g roughage/kg and were twice as great as those in cows given no roughage; lower concentrations were found in cows given 400 or 600 g roughage/kg. This information, together with the rumen concentrations of acetate and butyrate, was interpreted as indicating an inhibition of VFA absorption from the rumen of cows given no roughage. 5. Plasma glucose concentrations decreased rapidly for 4 h after feeding, the decrease being greatest in cows given 200 g roughage/kg. Non-esterified fatty acid concentrations also decreased after feeding 200 and 0 g roughage/kg rations, but concentrations were not high at any time. 6. It is concluded that chemical changes in the rumen correspond to feeding behaviour much more closely than changes in blood and therefore any chemostatic regulation of food intake probably occurs at the former site, with acetate playing a major role.

This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase in its pH optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:ATP mol ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for ATP of 0.4 mM. Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively.

When enzyme was solubilized by several techniques, HMG-CoA reductase activity in these extracts was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated at 4 degrees (Brown, M.S. Dana, S.E. Dietschy, J.M. and Siperstein, M.D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem 248, 4731-4738). In contrast, HMG-CoA reductase, solubilized from microsomes by a slow freeze-thaw method, was reversibility inactivated at 4 degrees over an interval of 2 h (Heller, R.A. and Gould, R.G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem 249, 5254-5260). In the present article irreversible inactivation at 4 degrees of crude solubilized HMG-CoA reductase, prepared from liver microsomes by a slow freeze-thaw technique, was investigated. In the absence of preincubation at 37 degrees, HMG-CoA reductase activity in the crude soluble extract had a half-life at 4 degrees of 4 h. Enzyme activity was more rapidly inactivated (t1/2=4 h) in extracts from younger (150 to 250 g) rats than in extracts from older (500 g) rats (t1/2=37 h). In contrast, partially purified HMG-CoA reductase was far more stable at 4 degrees (t1/2=312 h). However, when partially purified enzyme was treated with crude soluble extract, the enzyme was inactivated much more rapidly (t1/2=26 h). It is concluded that rapid irreversible inactivation of HMG-CoA reductase at 4 degrees is not an intrinsic property of this enzyme, but instead, this inactivation is caused by a factor or factors present in the crude soluble extract. While HMG-CoA reductase activity was rapidly inactivated in crude extracts from animals killed at the midpoint of the dark cycle, enzyme activity was inactivated much more slowly in extracts obtained from animals killed at the midpoint of the light cycle.

The modified enzyme retains 60-70% of the initial specific activity and is similar to native enzyme in pH and temperature stability. After tagging cysteine-390 with the fluorinated compound, the enzyme retains  substrate and inhibitor binding abilities; as shown by direct spectrophotometric titration of the active-site chromophores. The 19F NMR spectrum of the modified enzyme has been obtained by a Fourier transform NMR method. Although the transaminase is a dimeric enzyme, 19F bound at each subunit's cysteine-390 gives rise to only a single 19F resonance upfield from that of trifluoroacetic acid. The fact that the chemical shifts of the 19F probe differ in native and guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) denatured enzyme is interpreted as the effect of the native protein groups on the probe. The discordance between the changes induced by varying concentrations of Gdn-HCl on the 19F resonance parameters, on the one hand, and the changes in enzyme activity and prosthetic group absorbance, on the other, suggests that, in aspartate transaminase, cysteine-390 lies in an environment dissimilar from that of the active-site components.", "pmid": "856250", "mesh_set": "D000096 D001219 D001665 D001894 D003488 D005033 D006146 D007700 D009682 D010446 D011485 D011487 D013438", "score": 14.5155325, "rank": 4854, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Of the stable PGs, PGE is the main product and its formation is related to the dose of collagen. Indomethacin and eicosatetraynoic acid (TYA), both cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, inhibit TXA2 and PGE formation simultaneously. PRP of essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) rats, however, generates far less PG-endoperoxide like activity, TXA2 and PGE, though the release of serotonin (5-HT) is unaltered. In normal rats a marked inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase by TYA also has no effect on 5-HT release. For these 2 reasons the role of PG endoperoxides and TXA2 seems to be unimportant for the 5-HT release reaction. The diminished biosynthesis of PGs and TXA2 in EFAD PRP is not due to an impaired cyclo-oxygenase activity since addition of AA causes an equal formation of PGE in both types of PRP. The use of platelets as in-vitro model for testing anti-inflammatory activity of drugs is discussed.

The transmission in the spinal monosynaptic pathway was studied during repetitive stimulation of a motor nerve by 10 stimuli at 2, 5, or 10 Hz in spinal cats. Initially, the amplitudes of the monosynaptic responses rapidly declined, reaching a plateau after a few stimuli. The level of the plateau was inversely related to the frequency of stimulation. 2. This depression of monosynaptic response was seen only when the same pathway was stimulated; the response elicited from the lateral gastrocnemius was not depressed when preceded by stimulation of the medial gastrocnemius nerve and vice versa. Pretreatment with semicarbazide left the homosynaptic depression unchanged while suppressing the dorsal root reflex. The participation of a depolarization of primary afferents in the described depression is, therefore, unlikely. 3. The decrease of transmitter release by successive volleys, which is the cause of the observed depression, could conceivably be related to the depletion of transmitter stores. 4. A procedure is described, based on this assumption, which allows the calculation of transmitter turnover. The input-output relation in the spinal monosynaptic pathway is used to convert the amplitudes of monosynaptic responses to the amounts of transmitter, both relative to the maximum response. The changes of transmitter release are analyzed under the assumption that each volley releases instantaneously a constant fraction of the transmitter store available for release and that this store is replenished at a constant fraction of the depleted part per second. 5. The values of fractional release per volley were about 0.4, irrespective of frequency of stimulation. 6. The values of fractional replenishment per second ranged from about 1 to 5 on the average, depending directly on the frequency of stimulation. 7.

The procedure is based upon affinity chromatography with agarose-epsilon-aminocaproyl-fucosamine. The isolated enzyme was found to be pure by a number of different analytical gel techniques and is essentially free of other lysosomal gylcosidases. The purified enzyme exhibits a positive periodic acid-Schiff stain, suggesting that it is a glycoprotein. The purified enzyme has a pH optimum of 5.7 to 5.9, a Vmax of 27 mumol/min/mg of protein, and a Km of 0.19 mM with p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside as substrate. L-Fucose was the only possibly physiological effector of the enzyme which was identified; it exhibited a Ki of 1.6 mM, with p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-fucopyranoside as substrate. The enzyme has a subunit molecular weight of approximately 55,000 by Na dodecyl-SO4 electrophoresis in a variety of gel systems. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was indicated to be approximately 160,000 by sucrose density centrifugation, 300,000 by molecular sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-200, and 217,000 by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. The weight of evidence suggests that the enzyme is a tetramer. Incubation on the absence of sulfhydryl reagents under appropriate conditions generates a second alpha-L-fucosidase activity band on gels corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 to 50,000. This result suggests that the subunit is relatively stable and may reassociate to form active enzyme. Alpha-L-Fucosidase requires a high concentration of protein and the presence of a sulfhydryl reagent for stabilization. It is rapidly inactivated by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid, this inactivation being rapidly reversible by the addition of 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.

Experiments could last up to several hours. AiNa remained stable during prolonged experiments. The mean resting aiNa was 8-4 +/- 0-02 mM (S.E. of mean for eighty-nine fibres) and the mean resting membrane potential was 65-3 mV +/- 0-3 (S.E. of mean for eighty-nine fibres). 2. Reducing [Na]o to 1/10 normal (maintaining ionic strength with equivalent amounts of either Li or Tris) caused a large and rapid fall of aiNa. There appeared to be two components of the effect, a fast and slow. The initial fast rate of decrease was about 3-5 m-mole/min decreasing to half this value in about 1 min. The rate of decrease of aiNa was not linearly related to aiNa. The size of the fast change of aiNa was related to the magnitude of the Na gradient across the membrane. 3. High concentrations (2 x 10-4m) of ouabain caused a very slow rise of aiNa by 1 or 2 mn/hr. This was equivalent to a net Na influx of between 1 and 10 p-mole/cmi. sec, depending on whether or not a correction was applied to account for the increased surface area of the fibre caused by the invaginating cleft system. 4.

In the normal human brain the cerebellar cortex demonstrated the highest number of binding sites, in accordance with the large number of GABA interneurons in this structure. The hippocampus also displayed a high capacity to bind [3H]GABA, whereas cerebral cortical areas showed a lesser capacity. [3H]GABA binding was similar in many regions of the basal ganglia (amygdala, putamen, caudate or accumbens) but was lower than that for the cortical regions. The binding of [3H]GABA to membranes from the substantia nigra, thalamus and internal or external pallidum was lower than for the above regions. Subcortical white matter did not exhibit specific binding for [3H]GABA. In membranes prepared from Parkinsonian patients [3H]GABA binding was greatly decreased in the substantia nigra, but not in other brain areas examined.

This 'intermediate' alpha-mannosidase differs from the acidic form in its kinetic properties, its lack of marked inhibition by EDTA and its thermolability at 55 degrees C and physiological pH. Isoelectric focusing and ion-exchange chromatography show that it exists in at least two forms. The presence of a secondary peak at pH 5.5 in the pH/activity profile of normal plasma and the effect of heating at 55 degrees C indicate that such a form is present in normal plasma. The residual activity in the plasma of a calf with mannosidosis is therefore probably not the product of the defective gene. A differential assay, based on their different stabilities at 55 degrees C, has been developed for measuring the acidic and intermediate alpha-mannosidases in plasma. There was no correlation between the concentrations of the two enzymes in the plasma of Angus cows heterozygous for mannosidosis or in the plasma of normal animals. This precludes the use of the intermediate form as a reference enzyme for the acidic activity in a test for heterozygosity for mannosidosis based on the gene-dosage phenomenon.

The phospholipid content of hypertrophied muscles increased; the increase was proportional to the extent of hypertrophy and was distributed proportionally among the major phospholipid components. During the growth process, the hypertrophying muscles incorporated [3H]inositol into phosphatidyl-inositol more rapidly than did the contralateral, control limb muscles. The increased incorporation was evident 2 h after the operation and cannot be explained solely by an increased uptake of [3H]inositol. After growth had ceased, the incorporation of [3H]inositol into phosphatidyl-inositol gradually returned toward control levels. The increase in incorporation after tenotomy was prevented by simultaneous spinal section to abolish activity in the tenotomized limb muscles. By contrast, in rats that had been forced to swim for prolonged periods of time, there was no increased incorporation of [3H]inositol into phosphatidyl-inositol.

Fasting serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels declined in these subjects to a greater extent following the high fat compared to the high carbohydrate regimen (45% versus 28%, P less than 0.01 and 8% versus 3%, not significant, respectively). These changes reflected decrements in very low density lipoproteins alone. Despite similar increments in free fatty acid levels, (350% versus 270%, not significant) serum ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) concentrations increased 7-fold on the high fat diet compared to the high carbohydrate diet, P less than 0.001. The hyperketonemia of these men in response to the high fat, low calorie diet suggested the occurrence of a shift in hepatic free fatty acid metabolism toward ketogenesis rather than triglyceride synthesis. The associated decrease in the insulin: glucagon molar ratio raised the question of a possible role for these hormones in the adaptation.", "pmid": "835502", "mesh_set": "D000293 D000328 D001786 D001835 D004038 D004040 D004041 D005934 D006801 D007328 D050356 D008297 D009765 D014527", "score": 11.879802, "rank": 5789, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Comparison of the nearly pH-independent deuterium-isotope effect on V/Kmalate of 1.5 with the tritium effect of 2.0 by the method of Northrop (Northrop, D.B. (1975), Biochemistry 14, 2644) gives limits on the true effect of deuterium substitution on the bond-breaking step of 5-8 in the forward reaction and 4-6.5 in the reverse direction. Comparison of the deuterium effect on V/K with the 13C-isotope effect of 1.031 reported by Schimerlik et al. (Schimerlik, M.I., Rife, J.E., and Cleland, W.W. (1975), Biochemistry 14, 5347) allows the deduction that at pH 8 reverse hydride transfer is six to eight times faster than decarboxylation, which is thus largely rate limiting for the catalytic reaction. The absence of a deuterium-isotope effect on V at pH 7-8 and comparison of the Ki of pyruvate as an uncompetitive inhibitor of the forward reaction and a substrate for the reverse reaction indicate that at neutral pH the release of TPNH from enzyme-reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide (E-TPNH) is the rate-limiting step in the forward direction. The observation of a deuterium effect on V that approaches 3 at pH 4 and 10 shows, however, that, at very low and very high pH, hydride transfer may become partly rate limiting. In the reverse reaction, the probable rate-limiting step at pH 7 is the isomerization of E-TPNH, while at pH 8.5 and above V becomes too large to measure and appears infinite. Substitution of Co2+, Ni2+, or low levels of Mn2+ for Mg2+ gives similar deuterium-isotope effects, although the values of V and Kmalate vary considerably with metal.

Glycosylation of hemoglobin significantly increases the minimum gelling concentration of the deoxy conformation, as measured by sedimentation  equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Of the sugar derivatives of hemoglobin S examined by this method, those modified by D-galactose or lactose have minimum gelling concentrations (in the absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate) which are comparable to, or greater than, that of fully carbamylated hemoglobinS.", "pmid": "836884", "mesh_set": "D002241 D005782 D006441 D006451 D006601 D006801 D007700 D007785 D008320 D010084 D011485 D011487", "score": 12.310403, "rank": 5681, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "The development of the releasing factor concept.", "abstract": "After four decades of intense and competitive research, three hypothalamic releasing hormones (formerly factors) have recently been isolated and characterized. These are the decapeptide gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), tripeptide thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH), and the tetradecapeptide somatostatin. Some aspects of these hormones are discussed, and GnRH is considered in greater detail to demonstrate the difficulties involved in fulfilling completely the criteria which determine whether a substance can be accepted as a physiological releasing hormone. A substance immunologically similar to GnRH is present in rat hypophysial portal vessel blood, but, while the amount of this substance released into the portal circulation can be increased significantly by electrical stimulation of the preoptic area, no significant changes occur during the oestrous cycle or after long-term castration. This may be due to interference with the normal secretion of GnRH by the trauma and anaesthesia which necessarily accompany exposure of the pituitary stalk. However, the possibility exists that our preconceived notions regarding the changes in plasma levels of releasing hormones under physiological conditions may be incorrect. Thus it seems likely that changes in the rate of secretion of thyrotrophin is effected by throid hormones modulating the responsiveness of the thyrotrophs to a steady input of TRH. Evidence is presented for the existence of a similar mechanism for gonadotrophin secretion, and the role of steroid hormones and the priming effect of GnRH in modulating the responsiveness of the gonadotrophs is considered. The intrinsic connexions of the hypothalamus, the role of the hypothalamic aminergic systems and the autonomy of the hypothalamus with respect to anterior pituitary control present many problems which will prove difficult to solve.", "pmid": "29735", "mesh_set": "D000728 D000818 D004558 D004967 D005260 D007987 D007031 D008102 D008297 D018377 D010902 D010903 D010906 D011301 D051381 D013004 D013963 D013973", "score": 19.28833, "rank": 2518, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Other organic hydroxyperoxides will replace cumene hydroperoxide in oxidizing ethanol but less effectively. The cumene-hydroperoxide-dependent ethanol oxidation in microsomes was inhibited partially by cytochrome P-450 inhibitors but was unaffected by catalase inhibitors. Phenobarbital pretreatment of rats increased the specific activity of the cumene-hydroperoxide-dependent ethanol oxidation per mg of microsomes about seven-fold. The evidence suggests that cytochrome P-450 rather than catalase is the enzyme responsible for hydroperoxide-dependent ethanol oxidation.

Oral administrations of taurine (4-7 g/kg/day, for 3 days) prevented the stress-induced decline of adrenaline in the adrenal gland and this preventive effect could not be duplicated by the administration of L-isoleucine or DL-methionine. In hypophysectomized rats, the stress also induced a significant fall in adrenaline content of the adrenal gland, however taurine administration did not show significant preventive effects on the decline in adrenal catecholamines. The immobilized cold stress induced a significant increase in blood sugar and this increase was antagonized by pretreatment with taurine. Taurine had no significant effects on  the stress-induced increase in the activity of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and the turnover rate of adrenaline in the adrenal gland measured by the rate of decline of this amine following alpha-methyl-tyrosine administration. The administration of taurine, in both in vivo and in vitro, inhibited the release of adrenaline from adrenal medullary granules, but that of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase was not significantly affected. The stress-induced elevation of the blood level of corticosterone was not affected by taurine administration. These findings indicate that taurine antagonizes the stress-induced elevation of blood sugar by reducing adrenaline output from the adrenal gland.

For each of the compounds tested the mucosal (M) to serosal (S) flux was significantly larger than the S to M flux. Both M to S and S to M fluxes increased linearly with concentration, and the transport of one acid was not influenced by the presence of a tenfold greater concentration of a second heterocyclic acid. The fluxes decreased as the pH of the incubation saline was increased, but neither the M to S, nor the S to M fluxes could be described in terms of simple nonionic diffusion. It was found that the relation between the flux ratios of the transported acids and their pKalpha values could be described by an equation derived from consideration of the transport of a weak acid in a series three compartment system, and it has been concluded that the three compartment system provides a good working hypothesis for the mechanism of heterocyclic acid transport across rat jejunum. It was found that the best fit of the theoretical curve to the experimental data was obtained when the ratio of permeabilities to the ionized and nonionized forms of a weak acid at one of the barriers was assigned the value 5 X 10(-1).

Direct binding studies with purified oxidase, phospholipid-containing as well as phospholiptaining aid-depleted, demonstrated two sites of interaction of cytochrome c with the enzyme, with KD1  less than or equal to 10(-7) M, and KD2 = 10(-6) M. 2. The maximal velocities as low ionic strength increased with pH and were highest above ph 7.5. 3. The presence and properties of the low apparent Km phase of the kinetics were strongly dependent on the nature and concentration of the anions in the medium. The multivalent anions, phosphate, ADP, and ATP, greatly decreased the proportion of this phase and similarly decreased the amount of high affinity cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex formed. The order of effectiveness was ATP greater than ADP greater than P1 and since phosphate binds to cytochrome c more strongly than the nucleotides, it is concluded that the inhibition resulted from anion interaction with the oxidase. 4mat low concentrations bakers' yeast iso-1, bakers' yeast iso-1, horse, and Euglena cytochromes c at high concentrations all attained the same maximal velocity. The different proportions of low apparent Km phase in the kinetic patterns of these cytochromes c correlated with the amounts of high affinity complex formed with purified cytochrome c oxidase. 5. The apparent Km for cytochrome c activity in the succinate-cytochrome c reductase system of Keilin-Hartree particles was identical with that obtained with the oxidase (5 x 10(-8) M), suggesting the same site serves both reactions. 6. It is concluded that the observed kinetics result from two catalytically active sites on the cytochrome c oxidase protein of different affinities for cytochrome c. The high affinity binding of cytochrome c to the mitochondrial membrane is provided by the oxidase and at this site cytochrome c can be reduced by cytochrome c1. Physiological concentrations of ATP decrease the affinity of this binding to the point that interaction of cytochrome c with numerous mitochondrial pholpholipid sites can competitively remove cytochrome c from the oxidase.

{"title": "Regulation of superoxide dismutase synthesis in Escherichia coli: glucose effect.", "abstract": "Growth of Escherichia coli, based upon the fermentation of glucose, is associated with a low intracellular level of superoxide dismutase. Exhaustion of glucose, or depression of the pH due to accumulation of organic acids, causes these organisms to then obtain energy from the oxidative degradation of other substances present in a rich medium. This shift in metabolism is associated with a marked increase in the rate of synthesis of superoxide dismutase. Depression of the synthesis of superoxide dismutase by glucose is not due to catabolite repression since it is not eliminated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and since alpha-methyl glucoside does not mimic the effect of glucose. Moreover, glucose itself no longer depresses superoxide dismutase synthesis when the pH has fallen low enough to cause a shift to a non-fermentative metabolism. It appears likely that superoxide dismutase is controlled directly or indirectly by the intracellular level of O2- and that glucose depressed the level of this enzyme because glucose metabolism is not associated with as rapid a production of O2- as is the metabolsim of many other substances. In accord with this view is the observation that paraquat, which can increase the rate of production of O2- by redox cycling, caused a rapid and marked increase in superoxide dismutase.", "pmid": "21164", "mesh_set": "D000242 D004794 D004926 D005285 D005947 D006863 D008757 D010269 D013482", "score": 15.852478, "rank": 4150, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Formate inhibits cytochrome c oxidase activity both in intact mitochondria and submitochondrial particles, and in isolated cytochrome aa3. The inhibition increases with decreasing pH, indicating that HCOOH may be the inhibitory species. 2. Formate induces a blue shift in the absorption spectrum of oxidized cytochrome aa3 (a3 + a33+) and in the half-reduced species (a2 + a33+). Comparison with cyanide-induced spectral shifts, towards the red, indicates that formate and cyanide have opposite effects on the aa3 spectrum, both in the fully oxidized and the half-reduced states. The formate spectra provide a new method of obtaining the difference spectrum of a32+ minus a33+, free of the difficulties with cyanide (which induces marked high leads to low spin spectral shifts in cytochrome a33+) and azide (which induces peak shifts of cytochrome a2+ towards the blue in both alpha- and Soret regions). 3. The rate of formate dissociation from cytochrome a2+ a33+ -HCOOH is faster than its rate of dissociation from a3+ a33+ -HCOOH, especially in the presence of cytochrome c. The Ki for formate inhibition of respiration is a function of the reduction state of the system, varying from 30 mM (100% reduction) to 1 mM (100% oxidation) at pH 7.4, 30 degrees C. 4.

When injected with a subacute dose of selenite (2 mg Se/kg), rats previously fed stock diet volatilized more than twice as much of the dose compared to rats fed the purified diet, confirming earlier findings. Parallel dietary effects were also observed in vitro using subcellular fractions incubated with 75Se-selenite, glutathione, TPNH, and S-adenosylmethionine. The 9-000 X g supernate prepared from rats fed stock diet synthesized dimethyl selenide at approximately twice the rate of that prepared from rats fed purified diet.

Kidney fractions showed analogous changes with diet, although the activity of kidney microsomal fraction was very low. Only minor differences in the levels of glutathione reductase, nonspecific disulfide reducatse, and non-protein thiols were observed in liver and kidney from rats fed the two diets. Considering the effects of diet on the various enzymes known from our previous studies to be involved in dimethyl selenide synthesis, it was concluded that the enhanced ability of rats fed stock diet to synthesize dimethyl selenide results from the induction of a liver microsomal enzyme, apparently a Se-methyltransferase, caused by unknown substances in the stock diet.", "pmid": "10358", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002364 D003600 D004032 D004220 D005980 D006863 D007668 D008099 D008297 D008861 D008862 D009247 D051381 D012643 D013438", "score": 19.95368, "rank": 2260, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The concentration of this reagent giving a half-maximum rate of inactivation was 6 mMat pH 7.5. The inactivation was prevented by the presence of reduced glutathione in a competitive fashion, which indicates the active-site-directed nature of this reagent. The rate of inactivation was greatly accelerated in the presence of maleate, which is known to enhance the glutaminase activity of this enzyme. The presence of maleate increased the maximum velocity of the inactivation, but did not affect the affinity of the enzyme for 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine. Inactivation of the enzyme with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-[6=14C]norleucine as well as with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L[1,2,3,4,5-14C]norleucine resulted in a stoichiometric incorporation of radioactivity into the enzyme protein via covalent linkage.

Significant alterations in Purkinje fiber potentials occurred only with nadolol concentrations of 10(-4) M or greater. After 1 hour exposure to 10(-4) M, resting potential and action potential amplitude were reduced; at 3 hours, action potential rate of rise, phase 2 duration and action potential duration at 75% repolarization also were decreased. 10(-3) M nadolol also was depressant and, additionally, consistently reduced membrane responsiveness. Nadolol (10(-8)-10(-4) M) had no significant effects on effective refractory period. Ventricular and atrial muscle were less sensitive to all drug concentrations. Nadolol (10(-8)-10(-4) M) had little action on automaticity in normal, ouabain-treated or stretched Purkinje fibers but markedly decreased catecholamine-enhanced automaticity. In isoproterenol-treated Purkinje fibers, pA2 for nadolol was 8.2 and 7.7 for propranolol. Nadolol (10(-3) M or less) did not affect isometric force developed by isolated canine atrial trabeculae.

They were 0.19 and 0.83 mM at pH 7.5, and 0.055 and 0.83 mM at pH 9.1. In the presence of 5muM EDTA a sigmoidal curve was obtained for Mg2+ activation in the range of noninhibitory Mg2+ concentrations at pH 7.2. The apparent Km value for Mg2+ was 0.15 mM, and the Hill coefficient was 2.0. At pH 9.1 cooperativity among the Mg2+ sites disappeared, and the apparent Km value for Mg2+ was 0.055 mM. These Km values at pH 7.2 or 9.1 corresponded to the smaller of the biphasic Km values obtained without EDTA. In the absence of EDTA, no inhibition by Mg2+ was observed in the Mg2+ concentration range below 10 mM. In the presence of EDTA, the enzyme was inhibited markedly by Mg2+ at concentrations above 0.5 mM at pH 7.2, and was more sensitive to inhibition at pH 9.1. The effects of pH on the Km value for Mg2+ activation and on the Mg2+ inhibition contributed to an apparent shift of the pH optimum for activity induced by EDTA.

The osmotic permeabilities (Pos) were 2.4 +/- 0.4 and 4.8 +/- 1.0 micrometer/sec, respectively. The change in Pos induced by low pH was reversible. 2. Volume flow in the absence of an osmotic gradient was measured at normal and low pH. Values were 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 microliter/hr. cm2, respectively; the paired differences were significant (P less than 0.0025). This change in rate was partially reversible upon return to normal pH. 3. The potential difference (V) and short-circuit current (Is) across skins were measured under several conditions and the following equivalent parameters in a simplified electrical model were computed: total resistance (Rt); shunt resistance (Rs); electromotive force of the pump (ENa); and salt transport at open circuit (JNaCl). Representative figures were (a), at pH 7.4: Is = 14 +/- 1.6 microampere/cm2; Rt = 3.3 +/- 0.4 komega.cm2; Rs = 7.2 +/- 1.0 komega.cm2; ENA = 103 +/- 38 mV; JNaCl = 7.2 +/- 1.2 microampere/cm2; (b) at pH 2.28: Is = 8.3 +/- 2.1 microampere/cm2; Rt = 0.46 +/- 0.12 komega. cm2; Rs = 0.65 +/- 0.06 komega.cm2; ENa = 59 +/- 25 mV; JNaCl = 9.4 +/- 3.3 microampere/cm2. 4.

The present results suggest that, if such an effect occurs, it is localized only to a small fraction of the cell perimeter. Making certain assumptions that fraction could be as low as 0.003. 6. Low pH on the outside reversibly changes the electrical parameters of a 'tight' epithelium like the frog skin into values more typical of 'intermediate' epithelia; both the total and shunt resistances decrease to about 0.1 of their normal values.

Both functional events due to postsynaptic receptor stimulation (flexor reflex activity, motor activity) and biochemical changes have been considered. 1. Clonidine was less potent in stimulating the hindlimb flexor reflex activity of spinal rats than in inhibiting the alpha-methyltyrosine-induced disappearance of noradrenaline in the spinal cord and in the whole brain of rats. 2. The increase in flexor reflex activity due to clonidine (0.4 mg/kg) was virtually completely inhibited by phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg) and haloperidol (10 mg/kg), was partially inhibited by yohimbine (10 mg/kg) and piperoxan (60 mg/kg) and was not significantly inhibited by yohimbine (3 mg/kg) and tolazoline (50 mg/kg). 3. The potentiation by clonidine of the apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation of reserpine-treated mice was almost completely inhibited by phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg) but was not significantly affected by yohimbine (10 or 3 mg/kg) and only slightly inhibited by tolazoline (50 mg/kg). 4. Clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) caused a considerable inhibition of the alpha-methyltyrosine-induced disappearance of noradrenaline in the spinal cord and brain or rats and in the brain of mice. This effect of clonidine was completely antagonized by yohimbine (10 mg/kg). It was markedly antagonized by yohimbine (3 mg/kg), piperoxan (60 mg/kg) or tolazoline (50 mg/kg) but not by phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg) or haloperidol (10 mg/kg). 5. Clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) caused an inhibition of the accumulation of Dopa after decarboxylase inhibition in the noradrenaline-rich regions of the rat central nervous system.

{"title": "Reversal of orotic acid-induced fatty liver in rats by clofibrate.", "abstract": "The addition of 1 per cent orotic acid to a sucrose-enriched semipurified diet results in markedly fatty liver when fed to rats for 7 to 22 days. Light microscopy reveals lipid droplets, mostly small, distributed throughout the cytoplasm of all hepatocytes. Electron microscopy shows that all the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is broken into vesicles. Within the interior (cisterna) of each vesicle one or more lipid droplets are present. Morphologic signs of normal lipid transport (ER to Golgi apparatus to space of Disse) disappear: the Golgi elements are flattened and lack very low density lipoproteins particles; the Golgi-derived secretory vacuoles are not present. Biochemical analyses show an increase in hepatic triacylglycerol levels, to approximately 8 times the levels of sucrose-fed controls by the 7th day, 18 times by the 15th day, and 25 times by the 22nd day. Hepatic cholesterol levels increase, 2- to 4-fold. Serum triacylglycerol levels fall markedly; serum cholesterol levels are reduced. Immunoelectrophoretic determinations show that the apoprotein B component of plasma lipoproteins is practically absent at 7 days and increases slightly at 22 days. Reversal of an orotic acid-induced fatty liver is achieved by adding ethyl chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (clofibrate or CPIB) to the diet. By 8 to 16 days the ER of the hepatocytes returns to its usual parallel configuration and lipid droplets are not seen within its cisternae. Morphologic features of normal lipid transport reappear. GERL becomes prominent, distended with small particles, interpreted as lipid undergoing degradation. Lipid-containing residual bodies are common. Peroxisomes are more numerous than in hepatocytes of control rats. Liver triacylglycerol levels approach sucrose-fed control levels, and serum triacylglycerol levels return to chow-fed control levels. Hepatic cholesterol levels are similar to those of sucrose-fed and chow-fed controls, whereas serum cholesterol levels are lower. Serum apoprotein B levels return to chow-fed control levels. A sequence of events terminating in the removal of lipid from the hepatocytes is suggested by observation of morphologic changes following chlorophenoxyisobutyrate administration. This appears to involve transport of lipid into the cytosol where it accumulates as large spheres. Extensive accumulations of smooth ER appear. The cytosol lipid then disappears as the rough ER develops. Peroxisomes and mitochondria are prominent during the reversal process.", "pmid": "839735", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001059 D002994 D004721 D005234 D006056 D008099 D008297 D008830 D009963 D051381", "score": 17.247719, "rank": 3433, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In the majority of tests under steady conditions, the pH of e.c.f. was found to be lower than that of c.s.f. by between 0.03 and 0.08 units. No systematic pH gradients could be found to a depth of 5 mm beneath the surface of either medulla or cortex.4. When plasma P(CO2) was altered, pH(e.c.f.) changed with a latent period and speed of response related to the density of blood vessels. In vascular areas of the medulla and in the cortex, the latent period of 4 sec and the change of pH(e.c.f.) coincided with changes in ventilation. Changes in pH(c.s.f.) over the same areas were invariably slower.5. CO(2) buffering capacities were in the order plasma > e.c.f. > c.s.f. Typical values were respectively, -2.2, -2.1 and -1.6.6. The pH of e.c.f. was unaffected by the intravenous injection of H+ and only slowly by the injection of HCO(3)-. Only up to a depth of 1 mm beneath the surface was pH(e.c.f.) affected by superfusion of mock c.s.f. in the range 6.8-8.0 units. This response had a latent period of 2-3 min and was complete in 15 min.7. The pH of e.c.f. fell with hypoxia after a latent period of > 1 min and if all vasosensory nerves had been cut, pH(e.c.f.) was markedly affected by changes of blood pressure.8. These results indicate that even under steady conditions, the pH of e.c.f. and c.s.f. is not identical, that pH(e.c.f.) is more obviously affected by changes in P(a, CO2) than pH(c.s.f.) and that putative H+ sensors which drive respiratory neurones are likely to be similarly affected.", "pmid": "22741", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001769 D001794 D001921 D002245 D002415 D002555 D005110 D006863 D008526 D010100 D051381", "score": 24.00954, "rank": 1188, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "positive/labeled"}

Indomethacin produced significant increases in mean blood pressure, heart, kidney, and adrenal weights. The effects of aspirin and indomethacin on the blood pressures of rats with right adrenalectomy, left adrenal enucleation, and intact kidneys were studied. Administration of asprin twice daily (25 or 50 mg/kg) produced a fall in blood pressure, body and heart weight. Administration of 1 mg/kg twice daily of indomethacin resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure at 3 wk, and 0.1 or 1 mg/kg caused significant increases at 5 wk.

The successful experimental conditions included the use of (i) high concentrations of catechol and ascorbic acid to suppress nonreceptor binding, (ii) a very potent radiolabeled catecholamine (10 times more potent than isoproterenol), and (iii) membranes rich in binding sites for beta-adrenergic receptors. Thus, previous problems in accomplishing successful catecholamine binding to the beta-receptors have been overcome. The binding sites identified with (+/-)[3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol in the erythrocyte membranes have all the characteristics expected of true beta-adrenergic receptors. These include rapidity of binding, saturability, specificity for beta-agonists and antagonists, and stereospecificity [(-)isomers more potent than (+)isomers]. Physiologically inactive compounds containing a catechol moiety do not compete for occupancy of these binding sites. Dissociation of the radiolabeled agonist from the receptors is slow and incomplete in the absence of guanine nucleotides. In the presence of nucleotide, however, dissociation is rapid and complete. beta-Adrenergic agonists and antagonists compete for the (+/-)[3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol binding sites in a fashion parallel to their competition for the receptors, as previously delineated with the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol.", "pmid": "15249", "mesh_set": "D000319 D000818 D001001 D001667 D002395 D004910 D004912 D007545 D007700 D011433 D011941 D011943", "score": 27.082922, "rank": 738, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Effect of ascorbic acid on arylsulfatase activities and sulfated proteoglycan metabolism in chondrocyte cultures.", "abstract": "A correlation between increased arylsulfatase activities and decreased sulfated proteoglycan content in human osteoarthritic articular cartilage suggested a possible interrelationship between these parameters. Since we had previously shown that ascorbate caused a decrease in levels of arylsulfatase A and B activities in normal chondrocyte cultures, the validity of the above relationship was examined by measuring the effect of vitamin C on the biosynthesis and distribution of 35S-labeled proteoglycans and arylsulfatase A and B activities in cell extracts of chondrocytes derived from normal and osteoarthritic tissue. Arylsulfatase A and B activities were found to be reduced in the presence of ascorbic acid in all normal and osteoarthritic cell lines examined when measured 3, 6, 10, and 13 days after the introduction of the vitamin in the culture medium. Acid phosphatase activity, on the other hand, was found to be elevated in the presence of ascorbate. The inhibitory effect by ascorbic acid on arylsulfatase activities could be reversed by withdrawing the vitamin from the nutrient medium. Addition of EDTA to the cell extracts before assay also reversed the inhibiton. Sulfated proteoglycan biosynthesis as reflected in 35S-sulfate uptake per milligram of DNA was significantly increased in the presence of ascorbic acid. The distribution of the newly synthesized molecules between the cell layer and medium fractions was altered. In the presence of ascorbate, more deposition into the cell layer of newly synthesized macromolecules occurred.

Higher concentrations exhibit an opposite effect. Glutamic acid has a strong inhibitory effect on all the activators of glutaminase given separately. The inhibitory effect of glutamate increases on lowering the pH. On the other hand the potentiation observed on adding two stimulators is increased greatly in the presence of glutamate. On the addition of tyroxine to other stimulators a greater potentiation and rise of glutaminase activity are observed. The potentiation, which occurs on the joint addition of phosphate and tyroxine, is raised with the increase of the amount of glutamic acid, while on the contrary on joining phosphate with other stimulators potentiation is reduced. Potentiation is variable and depends on the pH. Preincubation of brain mitochondrial fraction with guanidine chloride inhibits markedly the stimulatory effect of all the stimulators used, but their joint addition almost abolishes the potentiating effect. In the presence of glutamic acid, due to the increase of the cooperative effect between the two stimulators, glutaminase activity is greatly increased and sometimes its inhibitory effect is not even observed. The data obtained indicate that in brain glutamic acid in the presence of phosphate+thyroxine cannot be considered as an inhibitor of glutaminase and that the important factor here is not so much the absolute levels of the activators as their favorable combinations.", "pmid": "11607", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001224 D001921 D002951 D004347 D004789 D005971 D005972 D006146 D006863 D008928 D010710 D051381 D013386 D013974", "score": 29.271572, "rank": 538, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "positive/labeled"}

The isoproterenol-induced release of the nucleotide was proportional to the decrease in adenylate cyclase activity. Since there is a large excess of Gpp(NH)p binding sites in the membrane, the isoproterenol induced release of Gpp(NH)p, rather than binding of the nucleotide, was used to measure the amount of guanyl nucleotide binding sites coupled to the activated adenylate cyclase. This amount, 1.5-2.0 pmoles/mg membrane protein, is only approximately 1% of the total Gpp(NH)p binding sites, and is about equal to the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in the membrane. Chromatographic analysis revealed that Gpp(NH)p was released from the membrane as an intact molecule. The findings suggest that persistent activation of the adenylate cyclase is due to persistent binding of Gpp(NH)p to the regulatory site, and that this GTP analog is a better activator of the adenylate cyclase than GTP because of its resistance to hydrolysis.", "pmid": "845287", "mesh_set": "D000255 D000262 D000495 D000818 D004789 D004910 D004912 D006150 D006160 D007545 D007700 D011433 D014422", "score": 29.086945, "rank": 552, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The pressor response to noradrenaline is enhanced and is now due to increases in both TPR and in cardiac output.6 The cardiovascular response of the anaesthetized rat to noradrenaline can be explained in terms of classical alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by the amine; the unusual form of the response may be due to an effective predominance of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effects in this species.7 It is suggested that the failure of exogenous noradrenaline to produce a rise in TPR results from a balance between the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated increase and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in this variable.

Collagen biosynthesis was not diminished in these cultures as compared to controls without additions or with beta-aminopropionitrile when measured by collagenase digestion. The formation of hydroxylysine-derived intermolecular cross links was inhibited 34 to 93% for 5,5'-dihydroxylysinonorleucine and 7 to 71% for 5-hydroxylysinonorleucine. The catechol analogs also inhibit the activity of lysyl hydroxylase as measured by specific tritium release as triated water from an L-[4,5-3H]lysine-labeled unhydroxylated collagen substrate prepared from chick calvaria. Since catechol analogs inhibit the formation of hydroxylysine in a cell-free assay, these compounds must pass into the cells of calvaria in this culture system to inhibit intracellular hydroxylysine formation and subsequently to diminish the reducible intermolecular cross links of the newly synthesized collagen.", "pmid": "14215", "mesh_set": "D000629 D000818 D002396 D002642 D003094 D046508 D003864 D004151 D004298 D006901 D007980 D009646 D008249 D012886", "score": 22.630154, "rank": 1472, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Assay of eluted fractions for Phe-Gly hydrolase activity revealed four distinct peaks of enzyme activity. These cytosol enzymes have been designated I, II, III, and IV in order of their elution from the column. Examination of the substrate specificity of the four enzymes by use of 20 mM peptide concentrations indicated the most discriminating substrates for the four enzymes were Leu-Gly-Gly, His-Met, Ser-Phe, and leucine amide, respectively. The mean distribution of the recovered peptide hydrolase activities against these substrates among the four enzymes I, II, III, and IV was 96.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 0.8%, respectively, for Leu-Gly-Gly; 0.6, 96.4, 2.4, and 0.6% for His-Met; 0, 0, 95.8, and 4.2% for Ser-Phe; and 20.8, 19.8, 5.6, and 53.8% for leucine amide. Ion-exchange chromatography resulted in increases in specific activity of 19-, 19-, 46-, and 3.5-fold for enzymes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The activity of all four enzymes, but especially III and IV, were stabilized by the presence of 150 muM dithioerythritol. Activity of each of the four enzymes was decreased 79 to 100% by 1mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate, HgCl2, 1, 10-phenanthroline, or 0.5 mM p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, except that the activity of enzyme I was decreased only 15% by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. No significant activation of the partially purified enzymes occurred in the presence of 500 muM Zn++, Co++, or Mg++. The four enzymes exhibited distinct pH profiles with optima at 7.5, 7.5, 8.5, and 8.0 for enzymes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Molecular weights of the four enzymes determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 were 58,500, 74,000, 97,500, and 113,000, respectively. All four enzymes lost more than 85% of their activity after 1 hr at temperatures of 50 degrees C or higher in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The Km values determined with the most specific substrates for each enzyme were 0.76, 0.44, 3.82, and 8.3 mM for enzymes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Recent evidence suggests that a significant amount of some small peptides are absorbed intact and hydrolyzed by cytosol peptide hydrolases. Adequate understanding of the function and control of these intracellular enzymes requires knowledge of the characteristics and substrates specificity of individual enzymes. The study described here demonstrates the presence of at least four cytosol peptide hydrolases with distinct substrate specificities.

Characterization and biological significance of two membrane sites with high affinities for Ca.", "abstract": "Net K movements in reconstituted human red cell ghosts and the resealing of ghosts to cations after osmotic hemolysis of red cells have been studied as functions of the free Ca ion concentration. The Ca-dependent specific increase in K permeability was shown to be mediated by a site close to the internal surface of the membrane with an apparent dissociation constant ap pH 7.2 for Ca (K'p1) of 3-5 X 10(-7) M, for Sr of 7 X 10(-6) M. Ba and Mg did not increase the K-permeability of the membrane but inhibited the Ca-mediated permeability changes. K'D1 decreased in a nonlinear fashion when the pH was increased from 6.0 to 8.5. Two different pK' values of this membrane site were found at pH 8.3 and 6.3. The Ca-activated net K efflux into a K-free medium was almost completely inhibited by an increase in intracellular Na from 4 to 70mM. Extracellular K antagonized this Na effect. Changes in the extracellular Na (0.1-140 mM) or K (0.1-6 mM) concentrations had little effect and did not change K'p1. The Ca-stimulated recovery of a low cation permeability in ghost cells appeared to be mediated by a second membrane site which was accessible to divalent cations only during the process of hemolysis in media of low ionic strength. The apparent dissociation constant for Ca at this site (K'p2) varied between 6 X 10(-7) and 4 X 10(-6) M at pH 7.2 Mg, Sr, and Ba could replace Ca functionally. The selectivity sequence was Ca greater than Sr greater than Ba greater than Mg. K'p2 was independent on the pH value in the range between 6.0 and 8.0 Hill coefficients of 2 were observed for the interaction of Ca with both  membrane sites suggesting that more than one Ca ion is bound per site. The Hill cofficients were affected neither by the ion composition nor by the Ph values of the intra-and extracellular media. It is concluded that two different pathways for the permeation of cations across the membrane are controlled by membrane sites with high affinities for Ca: One specific for K, one unspecific with respect to cations.

The content of water and creatine in mitochondria was found to be higher at pH 8.4, than at pH 72, the creatine content correlated with the water content. Structural creatine analogues, containing aminogroups with pKa greater than or equal to 9.5 or carboxyl groups, inhibited the infusion of creatine into mitochondria more strongly than substances having aminogroups with pKa less than 5. The penetrating form is creatine amphiion; the effect of pH on the permeability is probably due to the activation of the creatine transmitter. Rat skeletal muscle mitochondria contain creatine kinase at both sides of the inner membrane. This conclusion is based on the fact that under conditions, supplying the direct course of the creatine kinase reaction (the incubation medium contains Ca2+ and creatine; pH 7.8), ADP produces the stimulation of mitochondrial respiration up to the oxygen exhausting in a polarographic unit. Similarly, ADP irreversibly stimulates mitochondrial respiration in the presence of 1 mM EDTA, if EDTA and ADP are added after the preincubation of mitochondria in creatine-containing medium and after accumulating small amounts of Ca2+ by mitochondria.", "pmid": "2328", "mesh_set": "D000244 D000818 D002118 D003401 D003402 D004492 D006863 D008566 D008931 D010101 D051381 D014867", "score": 19.815992, "rank": 2319, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

These two conjugates were also produced simultaneously by using the post-mitochondrial fraction of rat, rabbit or guinea-pig liver. In contrast only the glucuronide was synthesized by human liver and only the sulphate by mouse and cat livers. Neither of these conjugates was formed by the kidney or the small or large intestine of the rat. A high sulphate-conjugating activity was observed in mouse kidney; the rate of sulphation of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethanol with kidney homogenate and high-speed supernatant preparations was 1.8 times greater than with liver preparations. The sulpho-conjugates of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethanol and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenylglycol were also formed by enzyme preparations of rabbit adrenal and rat brain; the glycol was the better substrate in the latter system.

These included purified capillaries and established cell lines of neuronal or glial origin. Since it has been suggested that glucose-6-phosphatase may be involved in sugar transport, the characteristics of that process were examined in these preparations. The pattern of uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose in four cell lines was shown to involve transport of the analog across the cell membrane that was more rapid than the subsequent phosphorylation of the sugar in the intracellular compartment. In the remaining cell lines and in purified capillaries, phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose was at least as rapid as uptake. No differences could be found between the cells in these two categories with respect to amount or localization of glucose-6-phosphatase, ability to phosphorylate 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, or ability to phosphorylate extracellular and intracellular 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In the course of these experiments, it was found that there was a rapid efflux of 2-deoxy-D-glucose from cells that had taken up this sugar. The efflux involves a dephosphorylation step catalyzed by intracellular phosphatase that releases free sugar in the cytoplasm. Glucose-6-phosphatase thus probably has no major role in the phosphorylation of glucose in brain cells, but acts in the more conventional sense, i.e. as a phosphohydrolase.", "pmid": "20441", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001921 D002460 D002462 D003837 D003847 D005952 D006863 D008099 D008297 D010770 D051381", "score": 16.593872, "rank": 3785, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "positive/labeled"}

The ratio of relative potency alpha: beta adrenoceptor antagonism after intravenous labetalol was approximately 1:7, whereas in the same subjects after oral labetalol the ratio was approximately 1:3 as previously reported. Using the inhibition of isoprenaline tachycardia to estimate the potency of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonism of labetalol relative to that of propranolol the potency ratio was 1:6. However, using inhibition of Valsalva tachycardia as the index, the estimated ratio was approximately 1:3. Estimates of relative potency using inhibition of tilt tachycardia were complicated by the additional effects upon blood pressure after labetalol not seen after propranolol. Labetalol produced adrenoceptor blockade at both alpha and beta sites in man sufficient to explain its therapeutic antihypertensive effect.", "pmid": "12778", "mesh_set": "D000317 D000328 D000959 D001794 D003864 D004305 D004983 D006339 D006801 D007545 D007741 D008297 D010656 D005082", "score": 19.53112, "rank": 2425, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "The release of vasopressin by nicotine: further studies on its site of action.", "abstract": "1. In cats anaesthetized with chloralose the release of vasopressin in response to nicotine injections was examined. This release was measured by assaying the hormone in samples of venous blood. 2. Nicotine injections were given by three different routes, namely intravertebral, intracarotid and intravenous. The first two represent close arterial routes to the medulla and to the hypothalamus, respectively, the effects of which could be compared to those following intravenous, i.e. systemic, administration. 3. Nicotine was found to increase vasopressin secretion by all three routes of administration. The potency of intracarotid injections was found to be no greater than that of intravenous injections, in sharp contrast to intravertebral injections, which were 4-5 times more potent. 4. In terms of vascular effects, intracarotid and intravenous injections of nicotine were found to increase blood pressure, whereas intravertebral injections of low doses of nicotine were always followed by a fall in blood pressure. Higher doses of intravertebral nicotine produce mixed results, pressor or depressor, in different animals. 5. The vasodepressor effect of intravertebral nicotine was part of a cardiovascular response which included a lowering of total peripheral resistance and of stroke work, whereas the cardiac output, the heart rate and the stroke volume remained essentially unchanged. 6. These results clearly indicate that a medullary area, which has been previously described, is the most sensitive site for the vasopressin releasing action of nicotine and that systemic administration of the drug induces vasopressin secretion by virtue of its action on the medulla, rather than directly on the supraoptic nucleus. 7. The results also indicate that the vasodepressor effect which follows the application of nicotine on the medulla is chiefly due to vasodilator effects on systemic blood vessels, with practically no action on cardiac function. The significance of these results is discussed.", "pmid": "850196", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001794 D002302 D002339 D002415 D005260 D006339 D007031 D007269 D007275 D008297 D008526 D009538 D014667 D014711", "score": 27.602495, "rank": 677, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Using a modified Oldendorf technique, 14C-labeled glucose analogues with a 3H2O reference standard were introduced into the cerebral circulation via the common carotid artery, and the radioactivity of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was counted and expressed in terms of a brain uptake index (BUI). Severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than or equal to 18%) resulted in approximately a 40% decrease in the BUI of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and a 45% decrease in the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose. Severe hypercapnia (PCO2 = 100 mm Hg) caused a 45% decrease in the BUI of both of these glucose analogues. Hypercapnia superimposed on severe hypoxia had no additional effect. Hypocapnia (PCO2 = 15 mm Hg) increased the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose by 35% of the control value, and this increase was extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition. When BUI values were plotted against pH rather than PCO2 for the same experiments, there was a good correlation with the calculated linear regression.

Under optimum conditions (pH 7.5, Mg2+ present), the carbon isotope effect is k12/k13 = 0.9989 +/- 0.0004 for the carboxyl carbon undergoing decarboxylation and hydrogen isotope effects are VmaxH/VmaxD = 1.09 +/- 0.04 and (Vmax/Km)H/(Vmax/Km)D = 0.76 +/- 0.12 with threo-D,L-[2-2H]isocitric acid. Deuterium isotope effects measured by the equilibrium perturbation technique under the same conditions are VH/VD = 1.20 for the forward reaction and 1.02 for the reverse reaction. Under these conditions the rate-determining step in the enzymatic reaction must be product release. Dissociation of isocitrate from the enzyme-isocitrate complex and the enzyme-NADP+ complex must be two or more orders of magnitude slower than the chemical steps. The catalytic activity of the enzyme is about tenfold lower in the presence of Ni2+ than in the presence of Mg2+.

{"title": "Regulation of galactose oxidase synthesis and secretion in Dactylium dendroides: effects of pH and culture density.", "abstract": "The effects of pH and growth density on the amount of an extracellular enzyme, galactose oxidase, synthesized by the fungus Dactylium dendroides were studied. Growth at a pH below 6.7 caused a decrease in the ability of the organism to release galactose oxidase. The enzyme retained by these fungal cells was liberated whenever the pH was raised to 7.0. Cycloheximide addition failed to inhibit the appearance of this protein; [3H]leucine added prior to pH adjustment was not incorporated into the released protein, These observations indicate the released protein is not newly synthesized protein. The retained enzyme would be secreted slowly over a 2-day period if the pH was not increased. In addition to regulating protein retention, pH was also shown to be associated with vacuolization, cell volume, culture density, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Cultures maintained at low pH were characterized by a dense growth consisting of highly vacuolated, buoyant, fungal hyphae. Increasing the pH from 6 to 7 caused a decrease in vacuole size. Cells grown at neutral pH maintained a lower density of growth and, based on activity measurements, synthesized 33% more galactose oxidase. Furthermore, cultures grown at pH 6.0 and maintained at a lower cell density produced galactose oxidase at a level similar to that of cells grown at neutral pH. Thus, the elevated density of the cell culture was inhibitory to galactose oxidase synthesis. The observed effects on protein synthesis and release were rather specific for galactose oxidase, since other extracellular proteins appeared in the earliest stages of growth.", "pmid": "15985", "mesh_set": "D000429 D001487 D005656 D005692 D006863 D009994 D014617", "score": 23.346788, "rank": 1312, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The hepatic extraction fraction and maximum excretory rate of conjugated cholate are greater than those of free cholate (studied after acute taurine depletion); the possibility that this difference might be due to greater bile-to-blood back-diffusion of un-ionized cholic acid (pKa 5-5) compared to that of taurocholic acid (pKa 2) has been investigated by varying the pH of bile by secretin or acetazolamide administration in the anaesthetized dog. 2. The mean biliary pH during free cholate excretion in the control state in twenty-three experiments was 7-5 (at which approximately 1% of cholate is un-ionized). Three to fourfold changes in the hydrogen ion activity of bile (which resulted in changes of the same magnitude in the percentage of un-ionized cholic acid) had no significant effect on the total (mainly free) cholate maximum excretory rate. It is concluded that back-diffusion of un-ionized cholic acid in the bile ducts is not an important determinant of the secretory performance of free cholate. 3. The bile flow rate associated with mainly free cholate excretion is much higher than that associated with taurocholate excretion at the same rate; the extra bile flow appears to arise largely by means that are independent of the osmotic effect of cholate excretion, as the osmotic coefficient (osmolality/total solute concentration) of bile containing mainly free free cholate (calculated directly) was only slightly greater than that of bile containing mainly taurocholate (obtained by extrapolation) at the same total cholate concentration. 4.

Sixty-one subjects--33 patients subjected to maximal treadmill stress testing, 23 normal subjects and 5 patients with a calcified aortic or mitral valve--underwent imaging with 99mTc(Sn) pyrophosphate to determine whether abnormal images are associated with (1) exercise-induced ischemia, (2) delayed clearance of tracer from the blood pool, or (3) calcified intracardiac structures. Myocardial injury was excluded on the basis of normal MB creatine kinase (CK) values in all patients with stress testing. All eight patients with an abnormal exercise stress test had normal images. Four of 25 patients with a normal exercise stress test had diffusely abnormal images. In some normal subjects diffusely abnormal images were present 60 minutes after injection of the tracer, but became normal 90 to 120 minutes after injection. Variations in clearance of tracer from the blood pool were noted in this group. Patients with a calcified aortic or mitral valve had normal images. We conclude that (1) exercise-induced ischemia is not associated with abnormal 99mTC(SN) pyrophosphate images; (2) images are not necessarily abnormal in patients with a calcified valve; and (3) delayed removal of tracer from the cardiac blood pool may result in diffusely abnormal images even in normal subjects; in these cases, repeat images should be obtained at least 2 hours after injection of the tracer to avoid false abnormal images.", "pmid": "842457", "mesh_set": "D000328 D000368 D002114 D003327 D005260 D006349 D006801 D008297 D008657 D008875 D009206 D005082 D013667", "score": 14.017247, "rank": 5070, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Alteration of prostaglandin biosynthesis in rat chloroleukemic tumor.", "abstract": "Data from our present studies demonstrate the capability of a 105,000 X g pellet from rat normal bone marrow, turpentine-induced hyperplastic bone marrow, and chloroma tumor to transform precursor arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. The activity of the prostaglandin synthetase systems in these tissues is inhibited by the known nonsteroid antiinflammatory drug indomethacin and by two unsaturated fatty acids previously demonstrated in other tissues. Although the overall biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was higher in the hyperplastic bone marrow than in the chloroma tumor, the PGF2alpha:PGE2 ratio was markedly higher (8-fold) in the chloroma tissue. This latter increase was probably due to the increased transformation of PGE2 into PGF2alpha by the NADPH-dependent PGE2 9-ketoreductase (an enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of PGE2 and PGF2alpha). These results indicate the greater capability of the malignant chloroma tissue to form PGF2alpha than of nonmalignant hyperplastic bone marrow. Although the role of PGF2alpha in the malignant myelogenous leukemic tumor is presently unclear, its increased formation in this tissue suggests that this substance may play a role in the hyperproliferative process.", "pmid": "269012", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001095 D001853 D005231 D006911 D006965 D066298 D007213 D007700 D007942 D007951 D011458 D011460 D051381", "score": 15.201623, "rank": 4504, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Restoration by histamine of the calcium-dependent electrical and mechanical response in the guinea-pig papillary muscle partially depolarized by potassium.", "abstract": "Electrophysiological and mechanical effects of histamine were observed in guinea-pig papillary muscle which had been depolarized and rendered inexcitable by elevation of potassium concentration in Tyrode solution to 27 mM. 1. Histamine (3 X 10(-7) to 3 X 10(-5) M) restored the action potential and tension development. The amplitude of the action potential was increased by 31.6 mV/10-fold increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Nifedipine (10(-6) M) abolished the electrical and mechanical responses which had been restored by histamine (10(-5) M) but TTX (10(-5) M) did not affect them. Reduction of the extracellular Na+ concentration to one half decreased the amplitude and the maximum rate of rise of the action potential restored by histamine (10(-5) M) while the peak tension was increased and an after-contraction occurred. 2. The maximum rate of rise and the amplitude of the action potential restored by histamine (10(-5) M) decreased with increase in stimulus frequency from 0.1-1.6 Hz. The peak tension decreased and then increased. The shape of the developed tension was also changed. In the presence of caffeine (1 mM), the only effect of an increase in stimulus frequency was a decrease in peak tension but the change in the shape of developed tension did not occur. 3. The electrical and mechanical responses restored by histamine (3 X 10(-6) or 10(-5) M) were depressed by metiamide (3 X 10(-6) M) but not by diphenhydramine (10(-5) M) or bufetolol (10(-6) M). 4. The electrical response restored by histamine (10(-6) or 10(-5) M) was enhanced by papaverine (10(-5) M) and depressed by N-methylimidazole (10 mM).

The level of binding was in the following order: DNA greater than polyguanylic acid greater than denatured DNA and ribosomal RNA greater than serum albumin greater than transfer RNA greater than polyadenylic acid. Reactions with nucleosides and nucleotides were not detected, and the binding of N-hydroxy-1-naphthylamine to DNA was not inhibited by the addition of nucleosides, nucleotides, methionine, or glutathione. The reaction rates were first order with respect to both DNA and N-hydroxy-1-naphthylamine concentrations. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA containing naphthyl residues yielded 3 nucleoside-arylamine adducts. The major adduct was identified by chemical, ultraviolet, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometric analyses as N-(deoxyguanosin-O6-yl)-1-naphthylamine. The other two adducts were identified as 2-(deoxyguanosin-O6-yl)-1-naphthylamine and its decomposition product. Direct evidence for acid-dependent arylnitrenium ion formation was obtained by isotope exchange upon solvolysis of N-hydroxy-1-naphthylamine in acidic H2 18O, and carbocation formation was indicated by the formation of the solvolysis products, 1-amino-2-naphthol and 1-amino-4-naphthol. These studies demonstrated the conversion of a carcinogenic N-hydroxy arylamine to electrophilic arylnitrenium ion and carbocation species that display high selectivity toward macromolecules.

These fluctuations were paralleled by increased ornithine concentrations, although the mean plasma levels of this amino acid remained far below those of arginine, i.e., 0.73 and 0.22 mmole/liter after 30 and 90 min, respectively. When expressed on a molar basis, arginine administration resulted in an almost stoichiometric rise in urinary urea excretion. These findings indicate that arginine is rapidly metabolized via urea and ornithine, the latter being transformed to glucose, as evidenced by a significant rise in the blood glucose concentration. Blood gas analyses and serum urea and blood ammonia concentrations determined after the load showed no significant deviations from preinfusion levels.

{"title": "The transfer of free fatty acids across the rabbit placenta.", "abstract": "1. The passage of fatty acids across the placenta was studied in 28 day pregnant rabbits (i) by comparing the fatty acid distribution in plasma free fatty acids (FFA) of umbilical cord artery and vein with that in maternal plasma and (ii) by infusing the doe at a constant rate with labelled palmitic, linoleic or arachidonic acids. During the infusion maternal and foetal plasma FFA specific activities were measured. 2. The mean levels of all the fatty acids studied (from twelve to twenty carbon atoms) were similar in both the umbilical vein plasma and maternal arterial plasma FFA, except for arachidonic acid, which was higher in foetal blood. The relative distribution of the fatty acids in umbilical arterial plasma similar to that in the vein, but at lower concentrations. The mean cord venous-arterial difference for each fatty acid correlated positively with the mean maternal arterial levels, with the exception of arachidonic acid. 3. During the constant infusion experiments the specific activities of the fatty acids in the maternal and foetal circulating FFA pools rose rapidly during the first 4 min then rose only slowly. Palmitic and linoleic acids were cleared from the maternal circulation in a similar manner and crossed the placenta at similar rates. 4. The average foetal specific activity in plasma FFA reached 15% of the maternal level for both palmitate and linoleate. The figure for arachidonic acid was half that for palmitic acid infused at the same time. 5. It is concluded that (i) all the major fatty acids present in foetal adipose tissue cross the placenta, (ii) the net transport of each fatty acid depends in part on maternal concentrations, (iii) the rate of metabolism of palmitic and linoleic acids is the same and both cross the placenta at the same rate.

Glucose (150 mg.) or tolbutamide (10 mg.) was given rapidly, i.v., one hour after  agavage of ethanol or saline (control).

Its effect on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and noradrenaline uptake into rat brain monoaminergic neurons was studied and compared with that of other antidepressants, particularly with that of imipramine and desipramine. Lofepramine inhibited both 5-HT and noradrenaline uptake into synaptosomal fractions in vitro but was 4 times more potent in inhibiting noradrenaline than 5-HT uptake, indicating the effect resembles that of desipramine. Noradrenaline uptake was also preferentially inhibited in synaptosomes from brain of rats treated previously with lofepramine or desipramine (i.p.). Pretreatment with SKF 525A (i.p.) did not diminish the effect of lofepramine, but rather potentiated it.

Both lofepramine and desipramine inhibited intraventricular noradrenaline uptake into synaptosomes without any effect on 5-HT uptake.

{"title": "Purification and properties of a beta-mannosidase from Aspergillus niger.", "abstract": "A beta-mannosidase (beta-D-mannoside mannohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.25) was purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture filtrate of the fungus, Aspergillus niger. The enzyme had an estimated molecular weight of about 120,000 and was a glycoprotein. Radioactive enzyme was prepared by growing the fungus in [14C]fructose, and this enzyme was used for the preparation of 14C-glycopeptides. The glycopeptides were purified on Sephadex G-25 and G-50 and were then hydrolyzed for sugar analysis. Two radioactive sugars were found in the glycopeptides and these were identified as mannose and glucosamine in a ratio of 2.5 or 3:1. Based on susceptibility of the enzyme to alkaline treatment and the formation of [3H]glucosaminitol in the presence of NaB3H4, the oligosaccharide is apparently attached to the protein in a GlcNAc-asparagine linkage. The beta-mannosidase had good activity on p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannoside but was inactive on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannoside as well as on other p-nitrophenyl glycosides. It also showed good activity on the beta(1 leads to 4)-linked trisaccharide of mannose and somewhat lower activity of the corresponding disaccharide. With each of these substrates the Km was about 1 mM, whereas with the p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannoside the Km was about 2 mM. The beta-mannosidase also released [14C]mannose from the Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc trisaccharide isolated from the lipid-linked oligosaccharides of aorta and released mannose from the disaccharides, Man-(beta1 leads to 4)GlcNAc and Man-(beta1 leads to 4)ManNAc.

{"title": "Acute and chronic responses to iodine deficiency in rats.", "abstract": "Various indices of thyroid function were measured in rats at early (2 to 26 days) and at late (up to 55 weeks) intervals after the onset of an iodine deficient diet (LID). Control groups received the same diet with iodine-supplemented drinking water. The measurements included: thyroid total 127I concentration, thyroid weight, [131i] mit/[131i]dit and [131i]t3/[131i]t4 after a labeling period of 18--24 h, serum T4, serum T3, and serum TSH. In the acute experiments serum T4 was significantly decreased at 6--7 days. Thereafter, the decrease was rapid and progressive, and by 26 days serum T4 was reduced to undetectable levels (less than .05 mug per 100 ml). Thyroid T4 decreased more rapidly than serum T4, suggesting that the turnover rate of thyroid T4 increased soon after the onset of LID. Serum T3, in contrast to serum T4 showed no significant change during the 26 day period. Thyroid T3 decreased less rapidly than thyroid T4, but was greatly reduced by 26 days. Presumably the turnover rate of thyroih was slightly but significantly elevated at 4 days, before there was any detectable decrease in serum T4. Thereafter, the results were somewhat variable, but there appeared to be no significant further rise in serum TSH up to about day 15, despite the observation that serum T4 fell rapidly during this period. Only after 15 days did serum TSH display a sharp increase. It is apparent from these results that there is no simple inverse relationship between plasma T4 and plasma TSH. In the chronic experiments serum T4 remained undetectable. Serum T3 was decreased to about 50% of the normal level at 7 weeks but there appeared to be no further decrease even at 55 weeks. Serum TSH rose to very high levels at 12 weeks but showed no further increase thereafter. Thyroid 127I concentration reached its lowest value at 15 weeks and showed no further decrease. Thyroid weight, on the other hand, appeared to increase progressively. To evaluate the effect of severe iodine deficiency on thyroid status, rats that had been on LID for 3-4 months were exposed to a cold environment (4--5 C). Body temperature and survival rates were compared with those of matched controls receiving LID + KI drinking water. The body temperatures of the latter group increased significantly on exposure to cold, and all animals survived. On the other hand, the body temperature of rats on LID alone began to decrease about 5 days after the onset of cold exposure, and when the diet was sufficiently low in iodine the majority of the rats died within 15 days. These results suggest that thyroid function in severely iodine deficient rats is not adequate to meet the challenge of acute cold stress. In this sense, therefore, these animals may be daid to display signs of hypothyroidism.", "pmid": "832626", "mesh_set": "D000208 D000818 D002908 D007455 D008297 D009929 D051381 D013961 D013972 D013974 D013997 D014284", "score": 18.890821, "rank": 2676, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The ME of animals similarly prepared was also examined for changes in the total activity and kinetic properties of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Four days following the administration of haloperidol (400 microgram/kg) or 10 days after castration, there was a significant increase in the rate of turnover of DA but not NE in the ME accompanied by an increase in the Vmax but not Km for the substrate or cofactor of TH. Furthermore, the administration of haloperidol to hypophysectomized rats also significantly increased the TH activity in the ME, indicating that such changes may occur independently of any changes in serum prolactin levels. Ten days after thyroidectomy, or three weeks after treatment with prophylthiouracil, there was a significant increase in the turnover rate of DA in both the ME and dorsomedial nucleus but not in the arcuate nucleus. No changes in the turnover rates of NE in any of the three areas were observed following thyroidectomy. In the ME, the increase in turnover of DA was accompanied by an increase in the total TH activity (Vmax) as welll as a decrease in Km for tetrahydrobiopterin but not tyrosine. From these results 4 conclusions were drawn: (1) following halperidol, castration, and thyroidectomy there are increases in the activity of dopaminergic terminals within the ME; (2) castration, haloperidol and thyroidectomy may influence the activity of dopaminergic terminals within the ME by different mechanisms; (3) changes in tyrosine hydroxylase and turnover of catecholamines within the ME may occur independently of changes in prolactin levels; and (4) local recurrent afferent circuits may exist in the arcuate nucleus region of the hypothalamus.", "pmid": "25696", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002369 D004298 D006220 D007031 D008297 D008473 D008781 D009638 D011441 D051381 D013965 D014446", "score": 45.364586, "rank": 68, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Mg2+ translocation across the thylakoid membrane: studies using the ionophore A 23187.", "abstract": "1. The degree of the light-dependent Mg2+ efflux across the thylakoid membrane is a function of pH. There is a considerable efflux at pH 7.2 which decreases to a negligible amount at pH 8.6. This conclusion is derived from studies using the divalent cation-specific ionophore A23187. The ionophore is active as an uncoupler at pH 7.2 even in the absence of added Mg2+, and completely inactive at pH 8.6 unless Mg2+ is added. The activity was assayed as the effect on both the rate of electron transport (stimulation at pH 7.2 and inhibition at pH 8.6) and deltapH. 2. Under conditions of maximal Mg2+ efflux, pH 7.2, and in the presence of EDTA, it is shown that Mg2+ is transported across the thylakoid membrane, but it is not diluted in the medium. 3. At high pH, light-induced proton influx is not compensated by Mg2+ efflux in the presence of a relatively permeable anion. However, in the presence of an impermeable anion, where cation efflux is necessary, Mg2+ efflux occurs, indicating its preference to K+ efflux. It is suggested that although light-induced Mg2+ efflux across the thylakoid membrane is evident, its magnitude is small and it is not diluted in the stroma. Thus, it seems hard to visualize how this transport is supposed to play an important role in CO2 fixation.", "pmid": "23949", "mesh_set": "D000900 D001693 D000001 D002462 D002736 D004579 D006863 D007700 D008274 D010101 D010944", "score": 11.673155, "rank": 5835, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The former metabolite is eliminated unchanged and elicits no pharmacological response. The sulfide, on the other hand, is readily reoxidized in vivo to sulindac. In each of seven in vivo models of inflammation, sulfide administered as such is more active than sulindac. The inference that the activity of sulindac might be attributed in whole or in part to the sulfide was tested directly by comparison of responses with concentrations of each reduction oxidation species in appropriate biological fluids. Regression analyses of circulation levels of sunlindac and sulfide vs. inhibition of rat paw edema, and of their levels in synovial fluid vs. response in the dog knee joint assay, show highly significant correlations only for sulfide.

{"title": "Specific action of narcotics on reflex activation of rat alpha-motoneurones.", "abstract": "Specific effects of narcotics (opiates) were studied on rat extensor alpha-motoneurones. The animals were anaesthetized with halothane, artificially ventilated and immobilized with N,N'-diallyl nortoxiferinium-HCl. The alpha-motoneurones were activated by tetanic stimulation of the cut ipsilateral gastrocnemius-soleus (GS) nerve. Morphine (2 and 4 mg/kg) administered intravenously, significantly increased the frequency of reflex discharges. In most of the neurones tested, naloxone (0.25 mg/kg) given intravenously, abolished the effect of morphine. In some neurones, however, naloxone induced a further activation. The dose of naloxone employed was ineffective when given alone. The effect of morphine was mimicked by an intravenous injection of levorphanol (1 mg/kg), but not by an equimolar dose of the stereoisomer dextrorphan, which suggests that the activating effect on alpha-motoneurones is a specific one. An intraperitoneal injection of apomorphine (1 mg/kg) reduced the effect of morphine. The effect of narcotics on alpha-motoneurones parallels narcotic-induced catalepsy and muscular rigidity, with regard to dose-dependence as well as to the antagonism of naloxone and apomorphine, and suggests that both catalepsy and muscular rigidity are mainly due to an activation of extensor alpha-motoneurones. Since this activation can be inhibited by spinalization of the rats, it can be inhibited by spinalization of the rats, it can be concluded that the activation is due to a supraspinal action of morphine, resulting in a decreased dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain.", "pmid": "840319", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000818 D001058 D003917 D004558 D007981 D008297 D009020 D009046 D009270 D009294 D051381 D012018 D013116", "score": 28.3418, "rank": 607, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Hormonal control of transcription in the rat uterus. Stimulation of deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent RNA polymerase III by estradiol.", "abstract": "DNA-dependent RNA polymerases were extracted from rat uterine tissue, partially purified and resolved by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. RNA polymerases I, II, IIIA, and IIIB eluted at the characteristic ammonium sulfate concentrations of 0.15, 0.28, 0.34, and 0.42 M, respectively. The sensitivity of each peak of polymerase to alpha-amanitin was examined and was shown to be essentially identical to the three classes of RNA polymerases in other mammalian systems. RNA polymerase I was insensitive to high levels of alpha-amanitin, RNA polymerase II was sensitive to low concentrations of alpha-amanitin (50% inhibition at 0.006 mug/ml) and RNA polymerases IIIA and IIIB were sensitive to high concentrations of alpha-amanitin (50% inhibition at 18 mug/ml). The alpha-amanitin sensitivity curve of total RNA synthesis measured in isolated nucleo demonstrated that the activity of each class of RNA polymerase could be quantitated in uterine nuclei. Thus the initial decrease in activity at low concentrations of alpha-amanitin (50% inhibition at 0.005 mug/ml) was attributed to the inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity, the second decrease in activity at higher concentrations of alpha-amanitin (50% inhibition at 15 mug/ml) was attributed to the inhibition of RNA polymerase III activity, and the activity which was resistant to the highest alpha-amanitin concentration tested was attributed to RNA polymerase I activity. When estradiol was given to immature rats 6 h before killing both RNA polymerases I and III levels in nuclei were increased significantly over the control values. The time course of these changes demonstrated that the increases in RNA polymerases I and III were first evident between 1.5 and 3 h following hormone treatment. Significantly, these increases in polymerase I and III in nuclei parallel the published increases for rRNA and tRNA synthesis following hormone treatment. However, the amount of RNA polymerase I and III was not altered upon extraction, suggesting that these changes are due to the alteration in chromatin template activity.

However, data on heavy episodic drinking (HED) and nomihodai, a several-hour all-you-can-drink system, are scarce. We surveyed the drinking behavior of undergraduate and graduate students at 35 colleges, and examined the association between HED and use of nomihodai. The study used a cross-sectional design conducted by a self-administered questionnaire. From December 2016 to March 2017, we sampled undergraduate and graduate students aged 20 or older at 35 colleges in the Kanto area, including Tokyo. The following items were measured: 1) frequency of drinking; 2) frequency of binge drinking in the past year; 3) nomihodai use; 4) the number of drinks consumed when using or not using nomihodai; and 5) sex and age for demographic data. Paired t-test was used to compare means between use and non-use state of nomihodai. The Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the significance of the distribution difference between the two types of states. A total of 511 subjects completed the questionnaire, including 274 men and 237 women. The amount of drinking was increased 1.8-fold (85.9 \u00b1 49.7 g vs. 48.2 \u00b1 29.5 g) among men and 1.7-fold (63.7 \u00b1 39.3 g vs. 36.5 \u00b1 26.7 g) among women during nomihodai use, comapred with non-use states. Among them, 109 (39.8%) men and 71 (30.3%) women reported HED only at nomihodai states.

At 21 degrees C incubation of NADH-ubiquinone-1 reductase (Complex 1) with trypsin caused selective inhibition of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase activity. The reduction of K3Fe(CN)6 by NADH or NADPH was unaffected, but a slow decrease in the rate of reduction of ubiquinone-1 by NADH was observed. 2. The pH-dependence of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase activity differed in Complex I and trypsin-treated Complex I. The trypsin-labile activity had a pH optimum of approx. 6.5, whereas the trypsin-resistant activity had a pH optimum of approx. 5.5 or less. 3. The trypsinlabile transhydrogenase activity was specifically inhibited by butanedione or phenylglyoxal and was identified with the enzyme catalysing energy-linked transhydrogenase activity in submitochondrial particles. 4. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate revealed that trypsin caused degradation of a polypeptide of mol.wt 20500 in parallel with the loss of transhydrogenase activity. 5. At 30 degrees C and higher trypsin concentrations, the rate of reduction of K3Fe(CN)6 by NADH or NADPH slowly decreased. Increased lability of NADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity to trypsin was observed when the endogenous phospholipid of Complex I was depleted by detergent or phospholipase A treatment. 6. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated that removal of phospholipid allowed much more extensive degradation of constituent polypeptides by trypsin.

{"title": "Duration of apnea needed to confirm brain death.", "abstract": "To determine the duration of respiratory arrest needed to attain a PaCO2 level high enough to provide maximal stimulation of respiration, we evaluated changes in PaCO2, PaO2 and apH during periods of apnea lasting as long as 10 minutes in 10 apparently brain-dead subjects. Before apnea, mean PaCO2 was 33 mm Hg. In seven subjects who did not breathe for 10 minutes, the mean rate of rise of PaCO2 was 3.2 mm Hg per minute. PaCO2 at 4 minutes was 50 mm Hg and at 10 minutes was 67 mm Hg. Three subjects breathed, two after less than 2 minutes of apnea, when PaCO2 was 47 and 54 mm Hg, and one after 4.5 minutes, when PaCO2 was 47 mm Hg. These data indicate: (1) that the threshold for respiratory stimulation may approach a PaCO2 of 60 mm Hg in patients with brain damage; (2) that the rate of increase in PaCO2 is such that, even in a normocapnic subject after 3 minutes of apnea, the PaCO2 may not be sufficiently high to stimulate respiration; and (3) if a patient is hypocapnic prior to the onset of apnea, PaCO2 may not reach 60 mm Hg even after 15 minutes.

Afferent presynaptic inhibition in the cuneate nucleus, evoked by volleys in the median nerve, and assessed by the size of the positive cuneate surface potential (P wave), the dorsal column reflex (DCR), and the increased excitability of primary afferent terminals of the ulnar nerve, was markedly enhanced by diazepam (0.1-3.0 mg/kh i.v.) and flunitrazepam (0.01-0.3 mg/kg i.v.), slightly enhanced by lower doses of phenobarbitone (3-20 mg/kg i.v.), but depressed by baclofen (1-10 mg/kg i.v.). Diazepam, flunitrazepam and phenobarbitone also increased postsynaptic inhibition in the cuneate nucleus which was measured by the decrease after conditioning volleys in the median nerve of the short-latency lemniscal response to cuneate stimulation. The GABA receptor blocking agent, picrotoxin, antagonized the effects of diazepam on pre- and postsynaptic inhibition in a surmountable way. After thiosemicarbazide (TSC), an inhibitor of GABA synthesis, both pre- and postsynaptic inhibition were greatly reduced and the augmenting effect of diazepam on both types of inhibition was nearly abolished. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), an inhibitor of GABA degradation, slightly enhanced pre- and postsynaptic inhibition; the effects of diazepam were unaffected by AOAA. Diazepam, flunitrazepam and phenobarbitone did not alter the resting excitability of primary afferent endings or of cuneo-thalamic relay (CTR) cells in the cuneate nucleus. After higher doses (30 mg/kg i.v.) of phenobarbitone pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, which were enhanced by 10 mg/kg of this drug, tended to return to pre-drug values or below. Phenobarbitone, in contrast to benzodiazepines, also depressed in a dose-dependent way the N wave, which is an index of the orthodromic excitation of the CTR cells. Baclofen strongly depressed the cuneate N wave, decreased the excitability of CTR cells, reduced pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, but had no effect on the resting excitability of primary afferent endings. Our findings suggest the following modes of action of the above mentioned drugs: 1. benzodiazepines enhance selectively the GABA-mediated pre- and postsynaptic inhibition in the cuneate nucleus; 2. phenobarbitone slightly enhances pre- and postsynaptic inhibition only in a narrow dose range, and in addition reduces the excitatory processes in the cuneate nucleus; 3. baclofen seems to depress the excitation of cuneate relay cells and interneurones postsynaptically; the depression of relay cells is probably nonspecific.", "pmid": "13311", "mesh_set": "D000613 D000625 D000818 D014151 D001418 D001640 D002415 D003975 D004347 D005071 D005445 D005968 D008526 D009433 D010634 D010852 D011422 D012663 D013569 D009435", "score": 24.816643, "rank": 1047, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Forms AI, AII and AIII were stable between pH 3.0 and 5.5, and had pH optima for CBZ-Glu-Phe at 5.6, 5.8, and 5.9, respectively. These activities were rapidly lost on heating above 60 degrees.

Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), toluenesuffonyl fluoride (TSF), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were inhibitory at a concentration of 10(-3)M. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptins, and antipain were not inhibitory, while chymostatin caused slight inhibition. No distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin A despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms (100,000, 200,000, and 420,000, respectively). In immuno-diffusion analysis, cathepsin AI, AII, and AIII which had been treated with EDTA, dithiothreitol, PCMB, and a high concentration of NaCl, gave the same precipitin patterns as the untreated enzymes, but treatment with 6 M urea caused a slight alteration of the pattern. After SDS-treatment (50 mM or more), the precipitin lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single, identical line. This suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin A are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related, and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces.

{"title": "Transitory postnatal hemolysis of calf red cells by amino acids.", "abstract": "Among the amino acids which can be solubilized to give a concentration of 300 mm at near physiological pH, histidine and proline caused a complete hemolysis of newborn calf but not of adult cow red cells within 20 to 30 minutes at 38 degrees C. While hydroxyproline, valine, and serine resulted in a partial lysis of calf cells, threonine, glutamine, and glycine were ineffective. In this communication, emphasis has been focused on the mode of the lytic process by histidine which was found to be affected by several governing parameters including the pH, temperature and the extracellular salts in the solution. Unlike human red cells suspended in isotonic histidine, both calf and cow cells lost little Na and K ions. In the presence of 300 mm histidine, both calf and cow cells displayed an instantaneous uptake of histidine amounting to 20 to 45 mumoles/ml RBC followed by a slow influx rate of 0.25 to 0.5 mumoles/ml RBC X min. The extent to which histidine entry was allowed by the cell was counterbalanced by Cl- efflux, resulting in little change in cell volume prior to hemolysis. Moreover, histidine-induced hemolysis can be prevented by 1 mm or lower PCMBS without a discernible effect on histidine influx suggesting a possible membrane lesion or damage at the outer surface of the cell. Hemolysis induced by histidine decreased substantially when a calf reached two months of age at which time the red cells containing the fetal hemoglobin are virtually depleted. The results of hemoglobin electrophoresis obtained during this postnatal period revealed that those cells resistant to histidine hemolysis almost invariably contain the adult type hemoglobin suggesting a selective, specific action of the amino acids on the fetal cells.", "pmid": "3653", "mesh_set": "D002731 D000375 D000596 D000818 D000831 D002417 D002463 D002712 D004912 D006454 D006461 D006639 D006801 D006863 D008274 D009994 D012965 D013395 D013696", "score": 13.564786, "rank": 5231, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Initial-rate studies of the reduction of acetaldehyde by NADH, catalysed by yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, were performed at pH 4.9 and 9.9, in various buffers, at 25 degrees C. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanism previously proposed for the pH range 5.9-8.9 [Dickenson & Dickinson (1975) Biochem. J. 147, 303-311]. 2. Acetaldehyde forms a u.v.-absorbing complex with glycine. This was shown not to affect the results of kinetic experiments under the conditions used in this and earlier work. 3. The variation with pH of the dissociation constant for the enzyme-NADH complex, calculated from the initial-rate data, indicates that the enzyme possesses a group with pK7.1 in the free enzyme and pK8.7 in the complex. 4. The pH-dependences of the second-order rate constants for inactivation of the enzyme by diethyl pyrocarbonate were determined for the free enzymes (pK7.1), the enzyme-NAD+ complex (pK approx. 7.1) and the enzyme-NADH complex (pK approx. 8.4). The essential histidine residue may therefore be the group involved in formation and dissociation of the enzyme-NADH complex. 5. Estimates of the rate constant for reaction of acetaldehyde with the enzyme-NADH complex indicate that acetaldehyde may combine only when the essential histidine residue is protonated. The dissociation constants for butan-1-ol and propan-2-ol, calculated on the basis of earlier kinetic data, are, however, independent of pH. 6.

{"title": "Effects of catecholamines and glucagon on glycogen metabolism in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.", "abstract": "Addition of 10 micron of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine to polymorphonuclear leukocytes suspended in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 6.7) activated phosphorylase, inactivated glycogen synthase R maximally within 30 s, and resulted in glycogen breakdown. Phenylephrine increased 45Ca efflux relative to control of 45Ca prelabelled cells, but did not affect cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) concentration. The effects of phenylephrine were blocked by 20 micron phentolamine and were absent in cells incubated at pH 7.4. The same unexplained dependency of extracellular pH was observed with 2.5 nM--2.5 micron glucagon, which activated phosphorylase and inactivated synthase-R, but in addition caused a 30-s burst in cAMP formation. 25 nM glucagon also increased 45Ca efflux. The activation of phosphorylase by phenylephrine and possibly also by glucagon are thought mediated by an increased concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ activating phosphorylase kinase. The effects of 5 micron isoproterenol or 5 micron epinephrine were independent of extracellular pH 6.7 and 7.4 and resulted in a sustained increase in cAMP, an activation of phosphorylase and inactivation of synthase-R within 15 s, and in glycogenolysis. The effects of both compounds were blocked by 10 micron propranolol, whereas 10 micron phentolamine had no effect on the epinephrine action. The efflux of 45Ca was not affected by either isoproterenol or epinephrine. The beta-adrenergic activation of phosphorylase is consistent with the assumption of a covalent modification of phosphorylase kinase by the cAMP dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of synthase-R to synthase-D can thus occur independently of increase in cAMP, but the evidence is inconclusive with respect to the cAMP dependent protein kinase also being active in this phosphorylation.", "pmid": "27235", "mesh_set": "D002118 D002395 D000242 D004837 D005934 D006003 D006006 D006801 D006863 D066298 D007545 D009504 D010656 D006005 D013217", "score": 22.689558, "rank": 1457, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Moreover, ABAB was excreted in the urine of all animals given ABBP orally. It may be concluded that ABAB was formed by reduction of the carbonyl group of ABBP. ABBP reduction was catalyzed by NADPH-dependent enzymes occurring in rabbit liver cytoplasm, and rat liver microsomes, and guinea pig liver cytoplasm and microsomes. The reductases were inhibited by sulfhydryl group reagents. The optimum pH of the cytoplasmic enzyme ranged from 7.2 to 7.8, and that of the microsomal enzyme was 6.5.

During ischaemic work with the calf muscles it could be shown that most of these blood constituents were only released from contracting muscles. Thus their time courses reflected the metabolic events in working muscles being not essentially disturbed by non-working parts of the body. Ischaemic work induced, however, substantial increases of HR and VE. In the course of non-ischaemic bicycle work HR and VE rose more rapidly in TR than in UT but were lower in TR during the steady state. During non-ischaemic work only the increased of femoral venous [K=1 closely mimicked the cardiorespiratory transients in TR as well as in UT. None of the other femoral venous substances showed such a rapid change or such typical variations between TR and UT. Cubital venous [K=1 and [Pi] approached femoral  venous concentrations only in second minute after start whereas pH, PCO2, and OSM increased mainly in venous outflow from contracting muscles. PO2 decreased in femoral venous blood of TR and UT, but in cubital venous blood it remained depressed only in UT.

Acidification to pH 5.0 or less, with hydrochloric acid or a lactic-acetic acid mixture, significantly reduced ammonia generation, but unlike fermentable substrates, did not lower the existing ammonia concentration. The lactic-acetic acid mixture did not reduce ammonia generation significantly below that found with acidification by hydrochloric acid. The effect of lactulose in reducing ammonia concentration is attributed to its role as a bacterial substrate in either increasing bacterial assimilation of ammonia or reducing deamination of nitrogenous compounds.

The release of ACh follows first-order kinetics, which suggests that the venom either lowers the ganglionic store of ACh, or continually reduces the rate of release. Since ganglionic ACh did not decrease in the presence of BWGE, it is likely that the venom continually reduces the rate of release. The rate constant for BWGE-induced release of ACh is depressed about 45% by treatment of the ganglion with either botulinum toxin or a low Ca++/high Mg++Ringer's solution. The rate constant is depressed about 30% by treatment of the ganglion with 8.3 microng/ml of cytochalasin-B. Since these agents inhibit the release of ACh which is elicited by electrical stimulation of the ganglion, it is suggested that one action of BWGE is the stimulation of some step in the physiological mechanism involved in the release of neurotransmitters. Treatment of the ganglion with tetrodotoxin had no effect on the rate constant for release induced by BWGE. The action of BWGE on the ganglion was not reversible after 10 minutes.

Our results indicate that a large number of narcotics acutely depress serum luteinizing hormone levels and that these reduced gonadotropin levels lead to a subsequent fall (1-2 hours later) in serum testosterone levels. The luteinizing hormone-depleting effect of the narcotics appears to represent a specific narcotic action since the (-)-isomers of the narcotics were much more effective than the ()-isomers, naloxone antagonized their effects and tolerance rapidly developed. Further, our studies indicate that the impairment of the functional and structural integrity of the secondary sex organs produced by chronic narcotic administration is not due to a direct effect of these drugs since they have no effect on the uptake of subcellular distribution of testosterone in the secondary sex organs or on the androgen-dependent accumulation of myo-inositol. Consequently, it appears that the testosterone depletion produced by the narcotics is solely responsible for their adverse effect on the secondary sex organs.

By immunofluorescence analyses, LGP2 localized mainly in the cytoplasm of NB cells after poly (I:C) treatment. In human NB tissue samples, cytoplasmic LGP2 expression was positively correlated with histological differentiation and inversely correlated with MYCN amplification.

{"title": "Properties of prostaglandin F2alpha receptors in bovine corpus luteum cell membranes.", "abstract": "The specific binding of 3H-labeled prostaglandin (PG) F2alpha to bovine corpus luteum cell membranes was a rapid (K1=1.1 X 10(4) M(-1)S(-1) and reversible (K(-1)=3.3 X 10(-4) S(-1)) process at 22 degrees C. The specific binding was also a saturable process exhibiting two classes of receptors with apparent dissociation constants (Kds) of 1.6 X 10(-9) M and 2.4 X 10(-8) M. The heterogenous nature of [3H]PGF2alpha binding does not appear to be due to negative cooperatively but merely to represent the existence of two independent groups of receptor sites with discrete affinities. Free energy changes of +11.9 and +10.3 Kcal/mol were calculated from the Kds of high and low affinity receptors, respectively. The binding of [3H]PGF2alpha to the membranes was not accompanied by any detectable changes in receptor-bound or free [3H]PGF2alpha. Addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled PGF2alpha resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]PGF2alpha binding to the membranes, with complete inhibition occurring at 10(-6) M. Other unlabeled PGs such as PGF1alpha, PGE2 (5-fold), PGE1 (120-fold), PGA1 and PGB1 (about 10,000-fold) were less effective when compared to unlabeled PGF2alpha in inhibiting [3H] PGF2alpha binding to the membranes. The metabolites of PGF2alpha, 15-keto-PGF2alpha and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2alpha had 100-fold less affinity for PGF2alpha receptors. 15(S)15-Methyl-PGF2alpha, an analogue of PGF2alpha, had a fairly high affinity but lower than its parent molecule. Various unsaturated fatty acids, indomethacin and 7-oxa-13-prostynoic acid had 3,000- to 10,000-fold less affinities for PGF2alpha receptors. Incubation of membranes with various enzymes revealed that PGF2alpha receptor molecules are protein in nature which require membrane lipids and specific phospholipids for binding function. Among the various phospholipids used, sphingomyelin was found to be very effective in restoring the loss of [3H]PGF2alpha binding in phospholipase C-treated membranes. N-Ethylmaleimide, but not other SH group alkylating agents inhibited binding. The binding was also inhibited by tetranitromethane, dinitrofluorobenzene and acetic anhydride.

Non-coding small RNAs are master regulators of gene expression with the potential to affect multiple molecular pathways. To evaluate whether hippocampal gene expression networks are chronically regulated by microRNAs after TBI, we sampled the dentate gyrus of rats with severe TBI induced by lateral fluid-percussion injury 3\u00a0months earlier. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed 30 upregulated miR-124-3p targets, suggesting that miR-124-3p is downregulated post-TBI (z-score\u2009=\u2009-\u00a05.146, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and in situ hybridization confirmed the chronic downregulation of miR-124-3p (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Quantitative PCR analysis of two targets, Plp2 and Stat3, indicated that their upregulation correlated with the miR-124-3p downregulation (r\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.647, p\u2009<\u20090.05; r\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.629, p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively). Immunohistochemical staining of STAT3 confirmed the increased protein expression. STRING analysis showed that 9 of the 30 miR-124-3p targets belonged to a STAT3 network. Reactome analysis and data mining connected the targets especially to inflammation and signal transduction. L1000CDS2 software revealed drugs (e.g., importazole, trichostatin A, and IKK-16) that could reverse the observed molecular changes. The translational value of our data was emphasized by in situ hybridization showing chronic post-traumatic downregulation of miR-124-3p in the dentate gyrus of TBI patients. Analysis of another brain injury model, status epilepticus, highlighted the fact that chronic downregulation of miR-124 is a common phenomenon after brain injury.

{"title": "Potassium release from the rat submaxillary gland in vitro. I. Induction by catecholamines.", "abstract": "Slices of submaxillary gland were incubated in vitro in an enriched Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate medium gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2 at 37 degrees C and the release of K+ into the medium was monitored after stimulation with alpha and beta adrenergic secretagogues under a variety of experimental conditions. K+ was released by the slice system after addition of norepinephrine, epinephrine or phenylephrine, but not after addition of isoproterenol. The extent of K+ release after norepinephrine depends on the dose of secretagogue and is higher when glucose, adenine and inosine, or all three substrates are absent from the medium. The effect of norepinephrine on K+ release is reversed by phentolamine but not by propranolol. Phentolamine also causes a 9.4-fold shift to the right in the dose-response curve to norepinephrine. Addition of ouabain to the incubation medium results in a higher extent of K+ release and prevents the reversal caused by phentolamine. The response to norepinephrine fails to occur when Ca++ is absent from the medium, either by chelation with ethylene glycol bis (beta-amino-ethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid or by elimination from the Krebs-Ringer solution, and shows gradations depending on the Ca++ content of the medium. By itself, however, Ca++ does not induce K+ release from the slice system. The following conclusions are derived from these observations: 1) the release of K+ ions from the submaxillary gland is mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors; 2) the net amount of K+ released is the result of two opposing and almost simultaneous mechanisms, a passive extrusion and an active reuptake; 3) the active reuptake of K+ depends on the availability of energy and is mediated through the ouabain-sensitive Na+-K+ activated adenosine triphosphatase; 4) the reaction is critically dependent on the presence of Ca++ in the incubation medium and probably involves an influx of Ca++ upon stimulation with alpha adrenergic secretagogues.", "pmid": "7665", "mesh_set": "D000319 D000818 D002118 D002395 D004347 D066298 D007700 D008297 D009638 D010042 D010646 D011188 D051381 D013363", "score": 32.255962, "rank": 367, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The basal levels of biotin in the two series of diets were: 0.51 and 0 mg/kg, respectively. There were four treatment groups in each of the two diet series: the practical diets were either supplemented with 0.5 mg D biotin/kg or 10% of either raw or heated egg white was added to the diet. The purified diets were supplemented with graded levels of D biotin (0, 0.25 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg). Raw egg white (1%) was added to the biotin unsupplemented diet.

The other groups received, in addition to morphine and pentobarbital, atropine (Group 3), scopolamine (Group 4), or glycopyrrolate (Group 5). After endotracheal intubation, gastric aspirates were examined for volume, pH and color. Neither premedication with morphine and pentobarbital nor addition of atropine or scopolamine to the premedication significantly altered volume. In patients treated with glycopyrrolate, volume was reduced to less than a third of that of patients in Group 1 (P less than 0.001), and the percentage of pH's higher than 2.5 was significantly greater than in other groups. The incidences of unobtainable samples and samples with pH's higher than 2.5 were greatest with atropine (32.0 per cent, P less than 0.05) and glycopyrrolate (58.1 per cent, P less than 0.01). In 60 per cent of the bile-stained specimens, pH's were below 2.5. It is concluded that because of its selective inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretions, glycopyrrolate appears superior to other anticholinergic drugs. The reduction of gastric juice volume and acidity produced by glycopyrrolate would have important clinical implications in case of accidental aspiration.

The value for the proportion of unblocked lysine is higher (approximately 5%) when determined by amino-acid analysis after acid total hydrolysis than when measured by means of the colorimetric method according to Carpenter (20%). The difference is designed as reversibly blocked lysine proportion. There is a linear correlation between the proportion of blocked lysine and the relative nutritional value as determined by means of the test organism Tetrahymena pyriformis.

The total oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) was 1.97 times higher after 96 h than in ungerminated seeds. Fifteen proteins, among 82 proteins separated by 2-DE, were highly related with ORAC and were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMS). The PMS revealed strong expression of granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) and glutathione S-transferase (GSTF) after 96 h of germination. Overall, the ORAC at 96 h exhibited a close relationship with the levels of phenolic acids, GABA, and proteins such as GBSS and GSTF.

{"title": "Regulation of the growth and development of sympathetic neurons in vivo.", "abstract": "The superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in the neonatal mouse and rat has been employed as a model system to study the regulation of ontogeny of presynaptic cholinergic nerves and postsynaptic adrenergic neurons. During postnatal development presynaptic choline acetyltransferase (ChAc) activity increases 30- to 40-fold, whereas postsynaptic tyrosine hydroxylase (T-OH) activity rises 6- to 8-fold. Transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the SCG prevents the normal development of T-OH activity and the normal accumulation of T-OH enzyme molecules in each postsynaptic neuron. The trans-synaptic regulation of T-OH development is apparently mediated by acetylcholine and postsynaptic depolarization, since pharmacologic ganglionic blockade also prevents normal maturation. Ganglion decentralization also prevents the normal maturation of adrenergic nerve terminals, and the development of end-organ innervation by SCG. Consequently, trans-synaptic factors regulate the ontogeny of adrenergic terminals as well as perikarya. Moreover, normal efferent as well as afferent connections are apparently required for sympathetic development, since removal of salivary glands and orbital contents, target organs of the SCG, in neonates also prevents T-OH development in the ganglia. The postsynaptic neuron contributes to the development of presynaptic cholinergic fibers in SCG. Selective destruction of adrenergic neurons in neonatal mice with either 6-hydroxydopamine or antiserum to nerve growth factor prevents the normal maturation of ChAc activity in presynaptic terminals of SCG.

The elevation of enzyme activity due to the modification was largely repressed by addition of ATP at a concentration of 1 mM or more during preincubation of 20 h at 0 degrees C. The repression was highly specific for ATP, though ADP and AMPPNP showed slight repressive effects. After complete hydrolysis of ATP added to the preincubation mixture, however, elevation of 30S dynein ATPase activity occurred. It is suggested that the repression by ATP of NEM-induced elevation of 30S dynein ATPase activity is simply due to a protecting effect of ATP on certain SH group(s) (probably SH1-type group(s)) around the active center of 30S dynein. When 30S dynein was maximally activated by modification with NEM, ATP or ADP did not significantly promote the inactivation of the modified enzyme upon further treatment with NEM, indicating that 30S dynein lacks the characteristics of SH2-type groups. On the other hand, ATP also showed a protective effect against inhibition of native 30S dynein by high concentrations of NEM.

At 2 x 10(-6) M piperoxan produced a considerable reduction of the response to injected noradrenaline but potentiated the response to nerve stimulation. 6 In isolated strips of cat splenic capsule, piperoxan produced a shift to the right of the dose-response curve to noradrenaline with no change of the maximum response.

{"title": "The effect of preganglionic nerve stimulation on the accumulation of certain analogues of choline by a sympathetic ganglion.", "abstract": "1. Cat superior cervical ganglia were perfused with a Krebs solution containing 10(-6) M [3H]homocholine (2-hydroxypropyl-trimethylammonium) or 10(-5) M [14C]triethylcholine (2-hydroxyethyl-triethylammonium). Preganglionic nerve stimulation (20 Hz) increased the accumulation of homocholine (3-2-fold) and of triethylcholine (2-1-fold). This increased accumulation during stimulation was not the result of increased metabolism. 2. The increased accumulation of homocholine or triethylcholine induced by pregnaglionic nerve stimulation was not reduced by tubocurarine or by atropine, but it was blocked by choline and by hemicholinium. These results suggested that preganglionic nerve stimulation increased choline analogue accumulation into cholinergic nerve terminals. 3. The increased accumulation of homocholine or of triethylcholine induced by preganglionic nerve stimulation was reduced when the Ca2+ concentration was reduced and was abolished in the absence of Ca2+. However, changes in the Mg2+ concentration which depressed acetylcholine (ACh) release by amounts comparable to those induced by altered Ca2+ concentrations did not alter the uptake of homocholine or triethylcholine. It is concluded that the uptake of choline analogues is not regulated by transmitter release but that stimulation increases the uptake of the choline analogues by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. 4. The accumulation of ACh by ganglia perfused with a Krebs solution containing choline and high MgSO4 (18 mM) was measured. The ACh content of these ganglia did not increase, although choline transport presumably exceeded that necessary for ACh synthesis to replace released ACh.

This contrasts with our earlier study in mice in which no such adaptation was found in gorgers. Three methods were used to re-evaluate lipogenesis from glucose carbon in fasted-refed nibbling and gorging rats. Two methods in which [U-14C]glucose was injected intraperitoneally before or after different test-meals confirmed an apparent 100- to 200-fold increase in lipogenesis (14C incorporation into fatty acids) in epididymal fat pads of gorgers; however, incorporation of 14C into total fatty acids in the whole body of gorgers was only five times greater than in nibblers. Quantitative tracer techniques (intravenous and oral [U-14C]-glucose) were used to evaluate glucose carbon flux (22-hour fasted) and lipogenic activation following the ingestion of a labeled glucose test-meal. Glucose carbon conversion to total fatty acids (whole rat) increased from 2.7 (24-hour fasted) to 11 microng C/minute/200 g body weight, a fourfold activation, within 15 minutes after feeding the test-meal to nibbling rats. The corresponding increase in gorging rats was from 3.7 to 53 micrgong C/minute/200 g body weight, a 14-fold activation.

{"title": "Formation of renal medullary lysosomes during potassium depletion nephropathy.", "abstract": "The biochemical correlates of droplet formation in renal inner medullary cells of potassium-deficient rats were studied. An increase in the activities of five hydrolytic enzymes typical of lysosomes was associated with an increase in the number and size of droplets observed during progressive potassium depletion. Acid phosphatase activity increased 7-fold whereas beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, cathepsin, and acid DNase increased 2- to 4-fold in medullary homogenates at 25 days of depletion. Following potassium repletion the activities returned to normal at a rate dependent upon the duration of potassium depletion. The decreases in enzyme activities were associated with a concomitant rapid disappearance of the droplets from medullary cells. Protein synthesis for new droplet enzyme formation was studied by measuring the rate of [14C]leucine incorporation into protein in medullary slices. The rate increased at 1 day of depletion and reached a maximum which was 139 per cent higher than control after 7 days of depletion. In droplets isolated from medullary tissue during progressive potassium depletion the rate of protein labeling with [14C]leucine and acid phosphatase specific activity increased in parallel. When droplet proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis, acid phosphatase activity was detected in a protein band which had been labeled with [14C]leucine, thereby suggesting new enzyme protein formation. The increase in enzyme and protein synthesis and a previously demonstrated increase in phospholipid synthesis and membrane formation indicate that potassium depletion induces specific alterations in renal inner medullary cell metabolism which result in increased lysosome formation.", "pmid": "839728", "mesh_set": "D000135 D000469 D000818 D002403 D003513 D003851 D005696 D005966 D007668 D007672 D007674 D007679 D007930 D008247 D008297 D011191 D014176 D051381", "score": 17.788256, "rank": 3158, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "The state of energization of the membrane of Escherichia coli as affected by physiological conditions and colicin K.", "abstract": "The bacterial protein colicin K, when added to sensitive Escherichia coli in the presence of 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine, cuases a doubling in fluorescence of the probe. Glucose and oxygen cause a decreased fluorescence while anoxia and cyanide cause a rise in fluorescence. These results in conjunction with the work of other laboratories suggest that colicin K causes a depolarization of the transmembrane electrical potential. Fluorescence in the absence of colicin K was relatively independent of KCl, NaCl, and MgCl2 concentrations below 0.1 M. Although colicin K caused rapid efflux of the K+ analogue 86Rb+, the fluorescence rise was only partially blocked by 0.13 M KCl. The level of fluorescence caused by the action of colcin K was inversely proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of MgCl2 over the range of 2 muM to 4 mM. This suggests that a Nernst electrochemical potential for an anion can counteract a membrane depolarization caused by colcin. After colcin K action, the fluorescence of the carbocyanine could be further increased by anoxia or cyanide. The distribution of the weak base dimethyloxazolidinedione indicated that the pH in the interior of aerobic E. coli supplied with lactate was alkaline by 0.1 unit and unaffected by colicin. These results suggest that colicin K does not completely depolarize the membrane potential and does not interfere with the component of membrane energization generated by electron transport. Colicin K does not act as a cationophore. The partial depolarization of the membrane may account for the inhibition of active solute transport caused by colicin K.", "pmid": "4085", "mesh_set": "D002462 D003087 D003486 D004926 D005947 D006863 D007700 D008274 D008564 D010710 D011189 D011199 D012413 D012965 D013050", "score": 13.0239105, "rank": 5448, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Renal tubular effects of chronic phosphate depletion.", "abstract": "The effects of chronic phosphate depletion on renal tubular function were evaluated by micropuncture and free water clearance studies in the dog. Proximal tubular punctures demonstrated that chronic hypophosphatemia led to a reduction in ratio of tubular fluid to plasma inulin in late superficial tubular from 1.59+/-0.08 in control animals to 1.29+/-0.06 in phosphate-depleted dogs, with proportional inhibition of calcium and sodium reabsorption. The chronic decrease in proximal tubular fluid reabsorption was confirmed by the analysis of sustained water diuresis in conscious, phosphate-depleted dogs, before and after repletion of body PO4 stores, and in control animals. Urine flow rate/100 ml glomerular filtration rate (V/GFR) was significantly higher in PO4 DEPLETION THAN CONTROL (15.8+/-1.1 VS. 10.7+/-0.82). In addition, acetazolamide infusion did not increase V/GFR in phosphate-depleted dogs (15.8+/-1.1 vs. 17.16+/-0.9), supporting the conclusion that inhibition of proximal tubular fluid reabsorption was responsible for the elevated urine flow rate. PO4 repletion over 5 days reduced V/GFR to 9.2+/-0.7 despite no change in urine osmolality and no change in GFR, further suggesting a specific reversible alteration in proximal tubular reabsorption in phosphate depletion. Although hypercalciuria was a constant finding in phosphate depletion (fractional excretion of calcium of 2.04+/-0.4% vs. 0.47+/-0.13% in controls), the enhanced distal delivery of calcium was not a crucial factor; acute phosphate infusion reduced urinary calcium excretion to control values without affecting the reduced proximal tubular reabsorption in either intact or thyroparathyroidectomized phosphate-depleted dogs the change in distal nephron calcium reabsorption was independent of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels since infusion of PTH failed to alter urinary calcium excretion. We conclude that chronic phosphate depletion leads to a reversible, sustained inhibition in proximal tubular reabsorptive fuction as well as a specific decrease in distal nephron calcium reabsorption.

Bile production ceased at 5 C but resumed when the temperature was raised to 35 C. The rate of flow and the total amount produced was unaffected by 24 hr of hypothermia but decreased when the cooling period was extended to 48 and 72 hr. The data of other workers was used to show a correlation between bile flow and oxygen consumption by the liver. Cooling also caused the release of potassium into the perfusate but it was quickly reaccumulated after rewarming; however, the extent and rate of reaccumulation decreased as the cooling period increased, as did the ability of the livers to retain the ion. Urea synthesis did not cease after cooling and after rewarming, the rate of synthesis increased as the period of hypothermia was lengthened. The maximum concentration of urea in the perfusate was found when rewarmed livers had produced 200 mumol of urea but at this point, control livers had produced 280 mumol. The concentration of glucose in the perfusate of livers maintained at 35 C  showed peaks at 2 and 9 to 10 hr after the start of perfusion.

When phenylalanine was present, a pronounced deviation from the Michaelis-Menten hyperbola occurred. The Hill coefficient (n) was 1.7, and Hill plots of velocity versus inhibitor concentrations resulted in a value of n' = 2.3, indicating positive cooperativity.

{"title": "Slow reacting substance as a preformed mediator from human lung.", "abstract": "Homogenates from human lung contained a preformed slow reacting substance (pSRS). The pattern of contraction on the guinea-pig ileum by pSRS was indistinguishable from that of SRS-A. The activity of pSRS could not be attributed to the presence of K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, or any prostaglandin including PGF2 or its 15-oxo derivative. As with SRS-A, pSRS could be absorbed onto Amberlite XAD-2 and silicic acid. Both were eluted from the former with 80 per cent ethanol and from the latter with a mixture of ethanol, ammonia and water. Both pSRS and SRS-A were resistant to the action of NaOH whereas their activities were destroyed by boiling in HCl. Arylsulphatase II B destroyed the activities of both pSRS and SRS-A. An antagonist of SRS-A, FPL55712, inhibited the action of pSRS at comparable concentrations to that of SRS-A. These experiments suggest that pSRS and SRS-A are identical. Thus SRS joins histamine and ECF-A as a preformed mediator. Although SRS was present in a preformed state the amount of material extractable was more than doubled by the anaphylactic reaction. The extraction of slow reacting substance from human lung without apparent requirement for antigen or antibody points to a possible role of this mediator in inflammatory reactions evoked by mechanisms independent of IgE and other tissue-sensitizing antibodies.", "pmid": "11180", "mesh_set": "D000941 D012898 D001578 D002803 D004987 D006801 D007082 D007114 D008168 D009119 D011453 D011460 D013189", "score": 12.372998, "rank": 5661, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Circular dichroism, optical rotatory dispersion, and absorption studies on the conformation of bovine rhodopsin iw situ and solubilized with detergent.", "abstract": "Circular dichroism, optical rotatory dispersion and absorption of rhodopsin, the visual pigment of bovine rod outer segment membranes, were studied in situ and in membranes solubilized with various detergents. The alpha-helical content of the membrane protein is approximately 30%. The membrane protein possesses little beta-structure. Solubilization of the membrane by the detergents, Emulphogene BC-720 and cetyltrimethylammonium salts, results in loss of protein helical structure and perturbation of aromatic residues. These effects are not observed on digitonin solubilization. In regard to the structural stability of the membrane during bleaching, the following conclusions were reached: (1) Delocalized conformational changes of rhodopsin in situ involving secondary and/or tertiary structure are very unlikely. (2) Localized conformational changes of rhodopsin in situ involving secondary structure must be limited to the involvement of no more than three amino acid residues and localized conformational changes involving tertiary structure must be limited to very short segments of the protein chain containing, at the most, only a few aromatic residues. (3) Large changes in the interaction of lipid and protein moieties of the membrane are unlikely. (4) The detergents, Emulphogene, cetyltrimethylammonium salts, and digitonin, significantly decrease the conformational stability of rhodopsin as compared to the in situ conditions. The effect is smaller with digitonin. Evidence is presented against a proposed mechanism by which optical activity of the prosthetic group, retinal, is induced by resonance coupling of the transition dipoles of retinal and the lowest energy transitions of the aromatic groups of the apoprotein, opsin. A mechanism in which atropisomers of retinal are preferentially bound by opsin is consistent with the present results. The optical activity of the prosthetic group is markedly changed upon solubilization of the membrane by detergent. This change in optical activity is probably coupled to changes in conformation of the protein moiety induced by solubilization.", "pmid": "843587", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002417 D002942 D003902 D008565 D009905 D010786 D011487 D012168 D012243 D013010 D013053", "score": 11.242435, "rank": 5915, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The infusion of VP caused antidiuresis and marked saluresis during water diuresis, whereas it was found to be diuretic and saluretic in hydropenic animals.

{"title": "Neutral amino acid transport. Characterization of the A and L systems in isolated rat hepatocytes.", "abstract": "Hepatocytes isolated from adult rat liver by enzymatic dispersion were used to investigate amino acid transport. Steady state and influx experiments were carried out with alpha-amino[1-14C]isobutyric acid and [1-14C]cycloleucine in the presence and absence of sodium under various experimental conditions. Hepatocytes concentrated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid to a 3-fold higher degree than cycloleucine. At low external alpha-aminoisobutyric acid levels (2 to 5 mM), about 25% and 75% of entry were accounted for by nonsaturable and saturable processes, respectively. The nonsaturable component was sodium-independent, and had the properties of passive diffusion. The saturable transport was dependent on external sodium; the rate of transport reached its maximal value with sodium greater than or equal to 75 mM. Sodium increased the apparent Vmax of transport without changing the apparent Km. This component was largely dependent on energy supplies and was strongly reduced at pH less than or equal to 6.5. The value for activation energy (Ea approximately equal to 15 kcal/mol, calculated from the Arrhenius plot) favors a mediated active transport. The Na+-dependent influx of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid was competitively inhibited by N-methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Ki approximately equal to 9.3 mM) and alanine (Ki approximately equal to 2 mM) to the extent of 70% and 100%, respectively. The N-methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid-sensitive part of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid influx represents transport through the \"A\" system, whereas the N-methyl-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid-insensitive part of transport is believed to occur through the \"ASC\" system. No evidence was obtained to suggest that alpha-aminoisobutyric acid is transported by the \"L\" system. Cycloleucine transport was a composite phenomenon involving at least two saturable processes, one of which was sodium-dependent and inhibited by alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, and probably represents entry through the A and ASC systems. The sodium-independent component was completely and competitively inhibited by 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (Ki approximately equal to 2 mM). This component exhibited accelerative exchange-diffusion and was pH-insensitive, properties which suggest a facilitated diffusion process. However, the weak inhibition exerted by oligomycin and cyanide along with the concentrative effect observed indicated that uphill transport was also operative. These data are in good agreement with those reported for the L system. We conclude that, as in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and in embryonic heart cells, the A, ASC, and L systems are operative in isolated hepatocytes for the transport of amino acids.", "pmid": "833114", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000621 D000818 D001667 D001692 D001693 D003486 D003515 D066298 D007700 D008099 D008297 D009840 D051381 D012964", "score": 33.287014, "rank": 320, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

When equimolar mixtures of glyoxylate and oxaloacetate were premixed for different lengths of time prior to addition to the assay mixture, the extent of inhibition increased with the premixing time. The results indicated that the inhibition by glyoxylate plus oxaloacetate is caused by a compound formed in a reversible interaction between the two components. Glyoxylate plus oxaloacetate and oxalomalate affected the enzyme in at least three different ways. They inhibited the enzyme in a reaction competitive with regard to the substrate isocitrate. This inhibition needed a certain time to be fully expressed. The time lag could be eliminated by premixing of the enzyme and inhibitor with NADP plus metal ion. Secondly, if the enzyme is premixed with NADP plus metal ions, a time lag occurs before the reaction rate approaches a constant value after initiation of the reaction with isocitrate. The inhibitors were found to enhance this effect of NADP plus metal ions on the enzyme. Thirdly, it has previously been shown that the enzyme can be activated by metal complexing agents. Glyoxylate plus oxaloacetate as well as oxalomalate are able to form complexes with metal ions and were found to cause an initial activation of the enzyme under certain assay conditions.

In older SHR, indomethacin (15 mg/kg) caused a significant pressor response, while in age-matched WKY, this dose had no significant effect. Indomethacin also showed a pro-hypertensive action in 10-14, 23-38 and 23-27 week old SHR with doses of 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively.

This hypothesis has been challenged since the demonstration of exchange between synaptosomal and exogenous GABA (G. Levi and M. Raiteri, Nature 250: 735, 1974). In our studies, rat cortical synaptosomes were incubated (25 degrees C) in various media containing 10 muM 14C-GABA. After the synaptosomes were removed by centrifugation, 14C and total GABA (fluorometric assay) in the resulting supernatant were measured. Uptake of labeled GABA, detected by a decrease in medium radioactivity, is Na+- and K+-dependent. Net GABA uptake, however, does not parallel 14C-GABA translocation. Exchange accounts for 20 to 70% of radiolabeled GABA accumulation depending upon the experimental conditions. On the other hand, GABA-deficient synaptosomes (prepared by treatment with 56 mM KCl and 1 mM CaCl2) show equivalent net and radiolabeled GABA uptake in Ringer's solution containing 1 to 4 mM KCl and 60 to 150 mM NaCl (average 4.6 nmol of GABA accumulated per mg of synaptosomal protein).

Although GABA homoexchange may contribute significantly to radiolabel accumulation by synaptosomes containing higher GABA levels (9.5-9.9 nmol/mg), homoexchange is limited in GABA-depleted synaptosomes.

G. & Vallee, B. L. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 4681-4686]. Until now, the biochemical basis of human alcohol metabolism had to be extrapolated from the properties and behavior of enzymes from other species, primarily horses and yeast. The biological determinants of human alcoholism have remained obscure, although recent evidence indicates a genetic predisposition, requiring delineation. A functionally distinct form of human liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which we have designated II-ADH, is provocative since, thus far, it seems to be unique to human beings. It has a high K(m) for ethanol and is remarkably insensitive (apparent K(I), 500 muM) to pyrazole and its derivatives, which are usually potent ADH inhibitors (K(I), 1 muM), a property that is the basis for the isolation of II-ADH. The affinity resin 4-[3-(N-6-aminocaproyl)aminopropyl]pyrazole-Sepharose binds all other known forms of ADH but not II-ADH, thereby separating it selectively by affinity chromatography. In turn, this has led to the establishment of its identity with that enzyme form which was previously known as the anodic band and characterized by a high K(m) for ethanol (20 mM at pH 7.5). The remarkable insensitivity of II-ADH to pyrazole inhibition has also permitted quantitation of its role in hepatic ethanol oxidation. At 5 mM ethanol, a saturating concentration for virtually all other forms of ADH, II-ADH contributes less than 15% to total ethanol oxidation. However, at intoxicating concentrations, e.g., 60 mM, it can account for as much as 40% of the total ethanol oxidation rate of liver, indicating a seemingly unique role for this enzyme form in ethanol elimination. Thus far, we have found the amount of II-ADH varies from liver to liver of individuals and is considerably more labile than the other molecular forms, phenomena whose inter- or independence requires further study. The isolation of human II-ADH advances efforts to recognize and understand biochemical mechanisms that may be biological determinants of alcoholism and alcohol-related disease states, now generally approached and managed largely as psychosocial disorders.", "pmid": "270680", "mesh_set": "D000429 D000437 D006801 D066298 D008099 D011720", "score": 12.1300535, "rank": 5731, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "The effect of chronic exposure to tobacco smoke on the antibacterial defenses of the lung.", "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of cigarette smoking on the host defenses of the lung, male CD rats were exposed to fresh whole smoke for up to 60 consecutive days. Intrapulmonary deposition of smoke and animal exposure levels, quantified with decachlorobiphenyl and other smoke tracers, indicated a daily cigarette exposure equivalent to approximately a pack and a half per day in man. Pulmonary alveolar macrophage function in situ was quantified by the inactivation of an aerosolized challenge of Staphylococcus aureus six hours after inoculation. Controls (n=120) inactivated 88.8+/-0.64% of the staphylococci. Exposure to whole smoke did not impair intrapulmonary antistaphylococcal defenses, with inactivation rates of 89.8+/-0.97% (n=49) and 89.1+/-0.46% (n=74) at 30 and 60 days, respectively. Inactivation distribution frequency analysis in controls revealed that 7% of animals had inactivation values greater than two standard deviations from the mean. With prolonged exposure mean with less skewing towards the abnormal. Alveolar macrophages harvested from smoked animals were comparable in viability and in vitro antistaphylococcal activity to controls, appeared to be metabolically activated and had specific stereologic ultrastructural alterations. These studies indicate that chronic exposure to tobacco smoke does not impair, and in fact may stimulate, the host defenses of the lung, as evaluated by in vivo and in vitro pulmonary alveolar macrophage function.", "pmid": "843645", "mesh_set": "D000818 D066298 D008264 D008297 D010587 D011650 D051381 D012141 D012907 D013211 D013997", "score": 10.575877, "rank": 6002, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Effect of ultraviolet radiation on pinocytosis in Amoeba proteua.", "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (4 000-10 000 erg X mm(-2) decreased membrane potential and input resistance of Amoeba proteus and induced formation of pinocytotic channels. Submaximal pinocytosis induced by UV light was additive to pinocytosis induced by K+ or Na+ and stimulated in the presence of EGTA. It was not inhibited by the presence of La+++ or by pretreatment with dibucaine. In these respects and with respect to optimum pH and pCa, UV induced pinocytosis. Accumulation of K+ in the amoeba membrane after a dose of radiation may explain the similarity between pinocytosis induced by UV light and potassium salts. Ca++ present during the period of irradiation inhibited the effect of UV light. Instead Ca++ applied after irradiation (1-20 mM) increased channel formation. This effect was stimulated the presence of local anesthetic drugs. It is suggested that high doses of UV light may induce channel formation by releasing Ca++ from the cell membrane into the cell (UV induced pinocytosis). Ca++ may be released at the moment of absorption of UV light in the membrane as well as during the period of depolarization which follows irradiation. Low doses of UV light may permit extracellular Ca++ to enter the cell and stimulate channel formation (calcium induced pinocytosis). Dithiotreitol (1 mM) applied after irradiation depressed both UV and calcium induced pinocytosis so these may be the result of the same structural change which involves the formation of disulphide bonds in the membrane.", "pmid": "5848", "mesh_set": "D000656 D000818 D002118 D003992 D004229 D004533 D006863 D007811 D008564 D010873 D011188 D012964 D014466 D014747", "score": 21.740757, "rank": 1688, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Renal response to acid loading in the developing lamb fetus, intact in utero.", "abstract": "Response of the fetal kidney to metabolic acidosis was studied in five fetal lambs, 115-125 days gestation, in order to evaluate the renal contribution to elimination of hydrogen ion during intra-uterine development. Experiments were conducted on healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact in utero, with catheters implanted at hysterotomy into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the bladder via the urachus, four or more days prior to the study. A metabolic acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid, 15 m mole/kg, intravenously over a period of 90 minutes. Serial arterial samples were taken and urine collected in fractions before, during and for three hours following the infusion, for measurements of pH, bicarbonate, lactate and electrolytes as well as urine output. During the infusion, urine pH fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was 6.34 three hours later (Figs. 1 to 4, Tabs. III to IV). Lactic acid infusion caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of 0.28 ml/kg/min at the end of the infusion, returning to control rates three hours later. Lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 mumole/kg/min at the end of infusion; titratable acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4 muEq/kg/min; the rates of excretion of lactate and titratable acid were still higher than control at the end of three hours. Ammonia excretion increased from 0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours after the end of infusion. The acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate. During the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours, about 800 mumole lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no more than half that amount. The diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of sodium and chloride, the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold following acid infusion; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate prior to the infusion. During the 90 minutes of infusion, blood pH fell from 7.36 to 7.13, base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 mEq/L and lactate rose from 2.2 to 14.8 mM/L; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood PCO2 and PO2 (Figs. 1 to 2, Tabs. I to II). During the following three hours of recovery, pH rose gradually to 7.29, base deficit and lactate fell to 7.4 mEq/L and 8.7 mM/L respectively. Since renal excretion of net acid and lactate was small, the decrease in blood base deficit and lactate levels during the recovery must therefore be mainly due to equilibration in various fetal compartments as well as placental transfer. These experiments indicate that, in the lamb fetus, intact in utero, the kidney although limited by immaturity of several mechanisms, is capable of responding to an acid load and thus can make a small contribution to fetal homeostasis. The increase in excretion of net acid is accompanied by loss of sodium and chloride in the urine.", "pmid": "479", "mesh_set": "D000136 D000138 D000641 D000818 D001639 D004231 D005260 D005333 D005865 D006801 D006863 D007668 D007773 D008431 D010710 D011247 D012756", "score": 15.204342, "rank": 4503, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The aromatizable androgen, testosterone, and RU 2858 suppressed both cyclic gonadotrophin secretion, indicated by the absence of corpora lutea from implanted ovarian grafts, and the behavioural response to oestradiol benzoate + progesterone injections in adulthood. The 5alpha-reduced androgen, dihydrotestosterone alone did not affect gonadotrophin secretion or female receptive behaviour, but like testosterone, it increased penis development in response to testosterone propionate, and this was positively correlated with copulatory efficiency, i.e. the ratio of intromission to mount frequencies. Nevertheless, ejaculation only occurred among animals that had received testosterone or RU 2858 + dihydrotestosterone. The results support the concept that during the preinatal period, neural conversion of androgens to oestrogens is important both for the suppression of female gonadotrophin secretion and behaviour patterns as well as for the organization of male behaviour patterns.

{"title": "Amphetamine effects on brain slow potentials associated with discrimination in the rat.", "abstract": "Slow potentials were recorded from the anterior cortex of rats during discrimination conditioning and the effects of various doses of d-amphetamine on these responses were examined. In the discrimination paradigm one tone (Sd) was followed at three see after the onset by food reinforcement while another tone (S delta) indicated that no reinforcement would follow. Slow potential (SP) responses were measured during the three-sec period following onset of the stimulus. For the first several training sessions the SP responses demonstrated a phase of generalization during which responses were the same to both stimuli. Thereafter, the responses to Sd were significantly greater than responses to S delta. d-Amphetamine produced a dose-related depression of SP responses to the reinforced stimulus in doses of 0.25 to 2.0 mg/kg. The effect of amphetamine on SP responses to S delta was biphasic; the lower doses (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) enhanced responses, no change was seen after 1.0 mg/kg and the high dose (2.0 mg/kg) depressed responses. This study demonstrates that the rat develops differential slow potential responses to reinforced and nonreinforced stimuli in a discrimination paradigm and that d-amphetamine produces a differential and dose-related alteration of these SP responses. It is suggested that the actions of amphetamine may be produced through interference with mechanisms of discrimination, by an effect on subcortical activating systems involving norepinephrine, and/or by activation of inhibitory dopamine receptors on cortical neurons.", "pmid": "263552", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001921 D003213 D003913 D004193 D004569 D005260 D051381 D011919 D011941", "score": 22.534752, "rank": 1491, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "positive/labeled"}
{"title": "Hybridization-initiated exonuclease resistance strategy for simultaneous detection of multiple microRNAs.", "abstract": "Multiple miRNA detection is often limited by sample, time-consuming, and complicated procedures. To address such challenges, we present a relatively simple and amplification-free fluorescent strategy based on hybridization-initiated exonuclease resistance for simultaneous detection of multiple miRNAs in a single tube. Single-stranded linear DNA probes were designed with dual roles of capture and reporter DNA, i.e. each DNA probe was labeled with biotin at the 3'-end for signal readout and amino at the 5'-end for probe immobilization. After target miRNAs specifically hybridized with the corresponding probes, the formation of double-stranded probe-target duplex protected the biotin on the probe from Exonuclease I digestion, thus resulting in high fluorescent intensities through the reaction between biotin and streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Coupling with the 3-plex fluorescent microsphere-based assay system, herein we successfully demonstrated the simultaneous and quantitative measurement of three sequence-specific miRNAs at concentration range of 2.5\u202fpM to 1.25\u202fnM and detection limits of 2\u202fpM. To meet high throughput and rapid turnaround time requirements, we have also exemplified that, even shortening the total reaction time within 1\u202fh, wider linear response range and lower detection limit were guaranteed. We further applied this assay to detect endogenous target miRNA levels from five kinds of cancer cell line and one normal cell line HEK 293T. This simple and rapid strategy will hold great potential for monitoring of multiple miRNAs biomarkers in biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis.", "pmid": "30172506", "mesh_set": "D001483 D015374 D045744 D005090 D006801 D035683 D009693 D013997", "score": 10.967875, "rank": 5956, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Further resolution of cytochromes of b type and the nature of the co-sensitive oxidase present in the respiratory chain of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata.", "abstract": "1. In membranes prepared from dark grown cells of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata, five cytochromes of b type (E'0 at pH 7.0 +413+/-5, +270+/-5, +148+/-5, +56+/-5 and -32+/-5 mV) can be detected by redox titrations at different pH values. The midpoint potentials of only three of these cytochromes (b148, b56, and b-32) vary as a function of pH with a slope of 30 mV per pH unit. 2. In the presence of a CO/N2 mixture, the apparent E'0 of cytochrome b270 shifts markedly towards higher potentials (+355mV); a similar but less pronounced shift is apparent also for cytochrome b150. The effect of CO on the midpoint potential of cytochrome b270 is absent in the respiration deficient mutant M6 which possesses a specific lesion in the CO-sensitive segment of the branched respiratory chain present in the wild type strain. 3. Preparations of spheroplasts with lysozyme digestion lead to the release of a large amount of cytochrome c2 and of virtually all cytochrome cc'. These preparations show a respiratory chain impaired in the electron pathway sensitive to low KCN concentration, in agreement with the proposed role of cytochrome c2 in this branch; on the contrary, the activity of the CO-sensitive branch remains unaffected, indicating that neither cytochrome c2 nor the CO-binding cytochrome cc' are involved in this pathway. 4. Membranes prepared from spheroplasts still possess a CO-binding pigment characterized by maxima at 420.5, 543 and 574 nm and minima at 431, 560 nm in C0-difference spectra and with an alpha band at 562.5 nm in reduced minus oxidized difference spectra.

The 2-nitroimidazole, Ro-07-0582, (1-(2-nitroimidazol-1-yl)-3-methoxy-2-propanol) is a compound of this type, and its effectiveness as a cytotoxic agent is dependent on drug concentration, contact time and temperature. In vitro, Ro-07-0582 in air at 37 degrees C does not cause loss of cell viability at concentrations up to 2 mM, even when in contact for several days. In contrast, hypoxic cells do not tolerate much lower concentrations of drugs, even if the contact time is only a few hours. When the temperature is raised above 37 degrees C, there is a pronounced increase in the slope of the survival curves; for example, at 41 degrees C (for 1 mM Ro-07-0582, (200 microng/ml), the slope changes by a factor of 2-0 relative to that for 37 degrees C. For cells in air at 41 degrees C, as at 37 degrees C, there is no toxic effect at the concentration of drug tested.

There was a slow component of 45Ca wash-out which is attributed to efflux to intracellular Ca. This efflux was strongly influenced by cations in the external solution, being reduced by 50% when Mg replaced Ca, and the residual efflux being reduced by 80% when choline replaced Na. 3. None of the substitutes tested, choline, K, Li, Tris or sucrose, could replace Na in maintaining 45Ca efflux into Ca-free solution. The Na-dependent Ca efflux showed sigmoidal activation by Na, indicating a requirement for the co-operative action of two or more Na ions in the extrusion of each Ca. 4. In the presence of 3-6 mM-Ca, Na deprivation failed to reduce 45Ca efflux. When K, Li and choline replaced Na the rate constant of 45Ca efflux increased. 5. Ca-dependent 45Ca efflux was studied by adding back Ca to Ca-free solutions. Its activation by Ca was hyperbolic indicating that one external Ca is involved in the extrusion of each Ca, consistent with a Ca:Ca exchange process. The apparent affinity for Ca and the maximal efflux were different in the presence of different monovalent cations. 6. 45Ca uptake was increased when Li or choline replaced Na in a solution containing 3-6 mM-Ca. Net Ca uptake also increased, but to a much smaller extent, supporting the idea of a Ca:Ca exchange process. 7. Mg had little effect in activating or inhibiting 45Ca efflux. Co appeared to act as a weak agonist and weak inhibitor of Ca-dependent 45Ca efflux. Ba strongly activated 45Ca efflux.8. Elevation of [Na]t, with ouabain treatment, did not appreciably affect Na-dependent 45Ca efflux. This may indicate that while this Ca efflux is dependent on external Na, it is not dependent on the Na gradient. Elevation of [Na]i had rather little effect on 45Ca uptake. 9 Exposure of slices to Li or choline solutions evoked a Ca-dependent increase in catecholamine output. This could be attributed to the observed increase in net Ca uptake in these conditions. Sucrose and Tris solutions produced Ca-independent secretory responses with quite different time courses. These results emphasize the importance of the Na substitute used in determining the secretory effect of Na deprivation. 10. Elevation of [Na]i did not change basal catecholamine release, nor did it greatly affect the secretory response to Na deprivation. 11. Only some of the secretory effects of NA deprivation can be attributed to the influence of Na on Ca movements.", "pmid": "857003", "mesh_set": "D000313 D000818 D001464 D001692 D002118 D002395 D002417 D003035 D066298 D008274 D012964", "score": 26.36881, "rank": 839, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The pretreatments of rats with diazepam (150 mg kg-1 d-1) increase significantly the adrenal catecholamine content. Consequently, the application of electrical and immobilization stress releases more catecholamines from the adrenal glands of the diazepam-treated rats and also produces higher incidence of ventricular extrasystoles. Furthermore, various pretreatments of rats with diazepam (5-150 mg kg-1 d-1) also lead to an increase in the catecholamine content of the adrenal gland. In diazepam-treated rats, the intravenous administration of ouabain produces a greater release of adrenal catecholamines as well as a greater incidence of cardiac arrhythmias.

After a 3 month feeding period, erythrocyte osmotic and peroxidative fragilities were determined in an osmotic test recorder. Dietary vitamin E had little or no effect on the osmotic fragility of red cells. Lead in the drinking water, however, decreased the osmotic fragility of red cells from deficient rats. Lead poisoning also markedly decreased the elevated peroxidative fragility characteristic of erythrocytes from vitamin E-deficient rats. This effect of lead in reducing the peroxidative fragility of red cells from deficient rats could be seen at levels as low as 25 ppm lead in the drinking water. Lead added in vitro decreased the peroxidative fragility of red cells from vitamin E-deficient non-poisoned rats, whereas neither mercury nor cadmium had such an effect. Lead may decrease the osmotic and peroxidative fragility of erythrocytes from vitamin E-deficient rats by \"tanning\" the red cell membrane.

These concentrations also inhibited enzyme release in a dose-response fashion although the inhibition of microtubule assembly was proportionately greater than the inhibition of enzyme release. Other aspects of PMN morphology were affected by colchicine. Cytochalasin B-treated PMN were rounded, and in thin sections the retracted plasma membrane appeared as invaginations oriented toward centrally located centrioles. Membrane invaginations were restricted to the cell periphery in cells treated with inhibitory concentrations of colchicine, and the centrioles and Golgi apparatus were displaced from their usual position. After stimulation and subsequent degranulation, the size and number of membrane invaginations greatly increased. They remained peripheral in cells pretreated with greater than 10(-7) M colchicine but were numerous in the pericentriolar region in cells treated with less than 10(-7) M. Similarly, untreated PMN that were permitted to phagocytose immune precipitates had many phagosomes adjacent to the centriole. After colchicine treatment, phagosomes were distributed randomly, without any preferential association with the centrioles.

In the beginning, a decrease in cardiac output seems to be the main cause of the lowering of the blood pressure; later, a decrease in systemic vascular resistance might be of greater importance.", "pmid": "14501", "mesh_set": "D000319 D001794 D002302 D003864 D004341 D006339 D006801 D006973 D008875 D010869 D012039 D014655", "score": 11.270309, "rank": 5912, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

This enzyme has a ration of Vmax for L-glutamine and L-asparagine of 2.0. The presence of glutamic acid in the growth medium is essential for optimal enzyme production and glucose inhibits the production of glutaminase-asparaginase. The purification procedure provides an overall yield of 40 to 45% from crude cell extract to homogeneous glutaminase-asparaginase and is adaptable to large scale production of the enzyme. The specific activity of homogeneous enzyme is 160 +/- 15 i.u./mg of protein and the E1% 280 is 9.8. No disulfide or sulfhydryl groups appear to be present on the enzyme. The isoelectric point of glutaminase-asparaginase by isoelectric focusing on ampholine polyacrylamide gel plates is 5.8. The Km values for L-glutamine and L-asparagine are 4.6 and 4.4 X 10(-6) M, respectively. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the D isomers of glutamine and asparagine at 87 and 69% the rate of the respective L isomers. L-Glutamic acid gamma-monohydroxamate is hydrolyzed at approximately the same rate as L-glutamine. The enzyme is not inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate (0.1 mM), L-glutamate (30 mM), or L-aspartate (30 mM). Ammonium sulfate (10 mM) inhibits the enzymatic activity.

{"title": "Conformational basis for the activation of adenylate cyclase by adenosine.", "abstract": "The ability of adenosine to stimulate adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] and increase adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels has important biochemical consequences. These include the suppression of immune responses and cardiovascular effects. Recent investigations involving the ability of adenosine and adenosine analogs to stimulate adenylate cyclase provided experimental data that appear to be correlated with the ability of adenosine and analogs of adenosine to exist in the glycosidic high anti conformation. 9-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyladenine, which is not stable in the high anti conformation, is inactive as a stimulator of adenylate cyclase. 2'-Deoxyadenosine is also not stable in the high anti conformation but its instability may be significantly decreased by intramolecular adjustments promoted by receptor or active site interactions. 2'-Deoxyadenosine does not activate adenylate cyclase in lymphocytes when ATP is the substrate but is able to activate adenylate cyclase when 2-fluoro ATP is the substrate. The inability of certain analogs of adenosine, with bulky groups substituted for hydrogen at the 8 position of the adenine base, to activate adenylate cyclase and increase either lymphocyte or cardiac cell cAMP levels is consistent with the designation of the high anti conformation as being the conformation required for the activation of adenylate cyclase. An understanding of the glycosidic conformation required by the extracellular adenosine receptor of the adenosine molecule provides the basis for designing nucleoside analogs of adenosine that will exert a desired effect on cAMP levels. The avoidance of unwanted immunosuppressive or cardiotoxic effects can be arranged by structural changes that prohibit the high anti conformation.", "pmid": "267918", "mesh_set": "D000241 D000262 D004789 D008968 D013329", "score": 23.552557, "rank": 1280, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Therefore, the reactivity of S2 can be estimated by measuring the decrement of the enzymatic activity.

Experiments were carried out with heavy meromyosin (HMM), S1 of which had heen blocked with NEM, to observe the reactivity of S2 alone. In the experiments done in the presence of F-actin, the Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured using the heavy meromyosin fraction after actin had been removed by centrifugation and gel filtration. 2. ATP and other nucleotides activated the reactivity of S2 in the presence of Mg2+. On the other hand, F-actin markedly activated the reactivity of S2 which had been increased by ATP, but not by the other nucleotides. 3. The above cooperative action of F-actin with ATP was not observed in the presence of Ca2+ instead of Mg2+, or above 0.2 M KCl.

The phenomenon occurred when the enzyme was added to the culture not earlier than 7 min before and not later than 5 min after the period of cell-DNA contact. The presence of trypsin during cell-DNA contact caused: (i) the alterations at cell surface, demonstrated by electron microscopy, increased release of 3H-amino acid-labeled material, and higher cell susceptibility to autolysis; (ii) the increase of both total and irreversible binding of DNA by the cells; and (iii) the decrease of early nucleolytic degradation of DNA by cells.

{"title": "Turnover of rod photoreceptor outer segments. II. Membrane addition and loss in relationship to light.", "abstract": "The rate of disk addition to rod outer segments (ROS) varies widely in Xenopus laevis tadpoles kept in cyclic light (12L:12D). When measured as radioactive band (3H-band) displacement during the 2nd day after injection of [3H]leucine, 75% of the daily increment of displacement occurred during the first 8 h of light. During the same interval, the number of open disks at the ROS base increased more than threefold. During the last 8 h of darkness, 3H-band displacement was undetectable and the number of open disks was reduced. These observations suggest the possibility that disk addition may occur discontinuously. During the 3rd and 4th days after injection of [3H]leucine, maximal displacement of the 3H-band occurred later in the day than on the 2nd day, its movement no longer corresponding to the increase in open disks. This delay in 3H-band displacement may reflect a time delay as a result of propagation of compressive stress in an elastic ROS system. Maximal disk loss from ROS as reflected in counts of phagosomes in the pigment epithelium occurred within 1 h of light exposure, and phagosome counts remained high for 4 h before declining to a low level in darkness. Modified lighting regimes affected the daily rhythms of shedding and disk addition differently, suggesting that control mechanisms for the two processes are not directly coupled. During 3 days in darkness, disk addition was reduced 50% compared to controls (12L:12D), whereas shedding was reduced by about 40%. Although reduced in level, shedding occurred as a free-running circadian rhythm. There was no evidence of rhythmicity of disk addition in darkness. In constant light, the rate of disk addition was not different from controls, but shedding was reduced by about 80% after the 1st day. This resulted in a 21% increase in ROS length. Among animals kept on a 2.5L:21.5D cycle, the rate of disk addition was reduced by 40% while shedding was maintained near control levels, resulting in a slight decrease in ROS length. These observations indicate that normal shedding requires alternating light and darkness, and that the daily rhythm of disk addition is due primarily to daily stimulation by light.", "pmid": "264121", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002462 D008027 D008854 D010588 D010786 D012374 D014981", "score": 17.14923, "rank": 3480, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Associated cardiac infection, including endocarditis, myocardial abscess, and graft infection, was present in 5 (36 per cent) patients. Death occurred within 2 months of operation in 11 (79 per cent) patients; it was due to infection in 9, cardiac tamponade in 4, and arrhythmias and heart failure in one. The diagnosis of purulent pericarditis was made before death in only 5 (36 per cent) cases, in part owing to masking of the usual signs of pericarditis in the postoperative patient. Since the introduction of antibiotics, the over-all incidence of purulent pericarditis has decreased.

The relative maximum rates of exchange of L-serine in equilibrium glycine and L-serine in equilibrium 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate in reaction 1 were not inhibited by high levels of substrates. The relative rates of these two exchange reactions were similar but were not identical. These results suggest that the catalytic interconversion and dissociation of substrates are of the same order of magnitude. Reaction 1 represents the transfer of a one-carbon group from the third carbon of L-serine to tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition studies showed that abortive enzyme ternary complexes are formed with L-serine and tetrahydrofolate compounds, which also contain a one-carbon group, e.g., 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.

A small but significant delay of intestinal evacuations was found with all compounds. Quantitatively, the oral doses required to delay diarrhoea beyond the first hour after castor oil challenge reflected the acute anti-inflammatory potency of the tested compounds. Qualitatively, the evolution of the effective doses with increasing delay was linear for potent inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis. The evolution for less potent compounds was markedly different and suggested the earlier occurrence of non-specific drug effects. Suprofen, the most potent of the series of compounds, produced the 1 h delay at an oral dose of 1.11 mg kg-1; the ED50 increased linearly to 115 mg kg-1 for a 4 h delay. Compared with other compounds the activity pattern of suprofen was consistent with that of a very potent, short-acting inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, which maintains its specific action over a wide dose range.

Ca uptake activities of chicken cardiac SR and rabbit cardiac mitochondria were measured by means of centrifugation, dual-wave-length spectrophotometric and Millipore filtration methods. The maximum Ca uptake capacity of cardiac SR was usually 50-60 nmoles/mg protein and the apparent binding constant was 2.0 X 10(6) M-1. The apparent Ca-binding constant of cardiac mitochondria under limited loading conditions was 2.4 X 10(5) M-1 at pH 7.4 and 5.9 X 10(4) M-1 at pH 6.8. In the presence of 100 muM Ca2+ at 28-29 degrees, the estimated initial rate of Ca uptake of cardiac SR ranged from 20 to 30 nmoles Ca/mg-sec, while that of mitochondria was 4.6 nmoles Ca/mg-sec under limited loading conditions at pH 7.4 and 0.64 nmoles Ca/mg-sec under massive loading conditions at pH 6.8, which was much closer to physiological conditions. In the presence of low Ca2+ concentrations, the initial rate of Ca uptake of cardiac SR was 0.5 nmoles Ca/mg-sec at 3.5 X 10(-7) M Ca2+ and that of mitochondria under massive loading conditions at 1 X 10(-6) M Ca2+ was 0.02 nmoles Ca/mg-sec at pH 7.4 and 0.004 nmoles Ca/mg-sec at pH 6.8. The Ca uptake activities were also examined using glycerol-extracted cardiac muscle fibers. Cardiac SR, 1.7 mg/ml, reduced the tension of maximally contracted cardiac muscle fibers to a level corresponding to about 30% of maximum tension, but in the presence of 14.3 mg/ml of mitochondria the maximum tensions of both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle fibers were maintained for at least 3 min. From these results the time course of relaxation of cardiac muscle induced by cardiac SR or mitochondria was calculated. It was concluded that, in the physiological contraction of cardiac muscle, the SR plays a major role in controlling intracellular Ca2+ movement; the Ca uptake of mitochondria is relatively insignificant.

The properties of inactive and active renin in human plasma and amniotic fluid were studied chromatographically. Activation was achieved at pH 3.3 with and without added pepsin. 2. Acid activation of renin was time- and temperature-dependent but was inhibited by dilution of the sample. The dilution effect was corrected by adding pepsin. Such characteristics indicate that activation at low pH is catalysed by intrinsic enzymes. 3. Separation and/or dilution of the activating enzyme during ion-exchange chromatography concealed the eluted position of inactive renin and reduced the amount recovered. Only after full activation of the eluted renin was achieved with added pepsin was a distinct peak of inactive renin exposed. 4. At pH 7.5 inactive renin carried a lower negative charge than the active enzyme. This charge difference was lost after activation. 5. No molecular-weight differences between active, inactive renin or the International Renin Standard were detected by gel filtration. No renin of larger molecular weight was present. 6. These findings will be helpful in purification studies of human inactive renin.", "pmid": "27328", "mesh_set": "D000653 D002845 D004789 D005260 D006801 D006863 D007700 D008970 D010434 D011247 D012083 D013696", "score": 20.750402, "rank": 1983, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In two series of cats all vestibular afferents except those innervating the saccular or utricular macula were transected and allowed to degenerate. Subsequent anatomical and physiological verification showed that the saccular nerve had been selectively spared in six cats. The utricular nerve was wholly or partly spared in five cats, but there was some possibility of contamination from other vestibular afferents. 2. The connections of the remaining nerve with dorsal neck motoneurons were studied 27-179 days after the initial surgery in preparations anesthetized with chloralose. 3. Stimulation of the saccular nerve usually evoked IPSPs in contralateral, EPSPs in ipsilateral neck motoneurons. Some of the potentials were disynaptic, many were later and probably trisynaptic. 4. The effects of utricular nerve stimulation were more complex, perhaps because of contamination by other vestibular, particularly canal, afferents. The predominant pattern consisted of ipsilateral inhibition and contralateral excitation, opposite to the effects of saccular nerve stimulation. Many potentials were disynaptic. 5. Various factors that may complicate interpretation of the results, including plastic changes following denervation, are considered. It is concluded that they are not a significant factor. 6.

After bilateral adrenalectomy, the alterations of plasma tryptophan are even more pronounced and liver tryptophan increases in contrast to tryptophan pyrrolase activity which remains unchanged after injury. The possible significance of the posttraumatic increase of tryptophan pyrrolase in intact animals for brain serotonin metabolism and hepatic gluconeogenesis is underlined.

Organ homogenates were centrifuged at 15000 x g and both supernatants and pellets were investigated for enzyme activity with the exception of the liver, where only the supernatant fraction was used. Tyrosine aminotransferase activity in the liver supernatant considerably exceeded the corresponding values in both supernatant and pellet of the remaining organs, in which a prevalence of the mitochondrial enzyme was obvious.

Four minutes after intravenous injection of labeled lymph chylomicrons, skeletal muscles with predominantly red fibers incorporated several times more chylomicron triglyceride fatty acids than thos with predominantly white fibers. Estimated lipoprotein lipase activity in total skeletal muscle was about two-thirds that in total adipose tissue of rats fed ad libitum. After a 24 hour fast, total activity in skeletal muscle was about twice that in adipose tissue.

{"title": "Synthetic peptides with the biological activities and specificity of human C3a anaphylatoxin.", "abstract": "Two peptides identical to the COOH-terminal sequence of human C3a anaphylatoxin and two analogs were synthesized by the solid-phase method and tested for biological activity. The synthetic COOH-terminal octapeptide, C3a-(70-77) or Ala-Ser-His-Leu-Gly-Leu-Ala-Arg, caused contraction of guinea pig ileum and uterus, release of vasoactive amines from rat mast cells, and increased vascular permeability in guinea pig and human skin. On a molar basis, the synthetic octapeptide possessed 1-2% of the biological activities of C3a and specifically desensitized smooth muscle to stimulation by C3a. Like natural C3a, the synthetic C3a=(70-77) was inactivated by digestion with carboxypeptidase B [peptidyl-L-lysine(-L-arginine) hydrolase, EC 3.4.12.3], which removed the essential COOH-terminal arginine. A synthetic nonapeptide [C3a-(70-77)-Gly], containing a glycyl instead of an arginyl COOH terminus, was approximately 1% as active as the octapeptide when assayed with smooth muscle. The COOH-terminal 13-residue peptide of C3a, C3a-(65-77), was equal in activity to C3a=(70-77); similarly, C3a-(65-77)-Gly expressed the same activity as C3a-(70-77)Gly. It is concluded that both the biological specificity and the activity of human C3a anaphylatoxin are determined by eight or fewer residues located at the COOH terminus of the natural protein.

The hypothermia induced by narcotic analgesics did not correlate with the striat\"al HVA increase. Pentazocine, cyclazocine and thebaine had no effect on the hot plate time. The maximum prolongation of hot plate time induced by morphine, methadone or piminodine occurred before the highest HVA increase. The highest increase induced by narcotic analgesics in striatal HVA content was twice the original concentration. This occurred 2 hr after 40 mg/kg of morphine; 2 hr after 20 mg/kg of methadone; 1/2 hr after 20 mg/kg of piminodine; and 1 hr after 60 mg/kg of pentazocine. Cyclacozine (10 and 20 mg/kg) and thebaine (10 mg/kg) did not alter the HVA content. With the exception of pentazocine, those doses of narcotic analgesics that caused equal increases in striatal HVA content were also equianalgesic. These results suggest that there are similarities in the structural requirements for antinociceptive and striatal HVA-increasing effects of narcotic analgesics. The neuroleptic compound haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) caused a fourfold increase in striatal HVA content making it twice as efficient as narcotic analgesics.

{"title": "Enzymatic susceptibility and spontaneous release of human melanoma tumor-associated antigens.", "abstract": "A chimpanzee anti-human melanoma antiserum was used to study the enzymatic susceptibility and spontaneous release into tissue culture medium of human melanoma tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Limited proteolytic digestion of melanoma cells with trypsin or with pronase rendered these cells refractory to lysis by the chimpanzee antiserum and complement. Longer periods of incubation of higher concentrations of enzyme caused an increased sensitivity to lysis. Digestion of melanoma cells with neuraminidase apparently exposed antigens reactive with natural antibodies in rabbit complement because cells so treated had a marked increase in sensitivity to cytolysis. Absorption of the complement with either neuraminidase-treated human melanoma cells or washed human spleen cells prior to its use in the cytotoxicity assay removed this activity. When absorbed complement was used, neuraminidase had no noticeable effect on the expression of malanoma TAA. These results suggest that proteolytic digestion of melanoma cells may prove to be a useful means of solubilizing TAA. The spontaneous release of melanoma cell membrane TAA was studied. Protein precipitated by (NH4)2SO4 from four of six samples of tissue culture medium used to feed malanoma cell lines contained significant antigenic activity compared to a control \"antigen\" preparation, whereas one preparation contained only limited TAA activity. One melanoma cell line that apparently failed to release TAA into the culture medium had previously become nonreactive with the chimpanzee antiserum. From these data, we conclude that melanoma cells growing in tissue culture rapidly release large amounts of TAA into the culture media and, as a result, the spent culture medium may be a good source for obtaining TAA for further study.

Circular dichroism measurements were employed as a measure of the base-stacking. The self-association of ATP is pH dependent with the protonation of the adenine ring helping stabilize the association. Highly charged counterions alter this aggregation. At pH 2.8 and 20 degrees C, a dimerization constant of 88 M-1 is obtained, while an isodesmic model leads to an equilibrium constant of 158 M-1. With increasing pH, the association constants decrease. At pH 2.8 there is a very strong temperature dependence of the CD amplitude. These results indicate the existence of additional electrostatic stabilization for the stacking of the adenine rings. At acidic pHs, models are proposed to explain this high degree of stability and a calculation of the approximate electrostatic contribution to the aggregation shows it to be of the proper magnitude.", "pmid": "2349", "mesh_set": "D000255 D001665 D002942 D006863 D008433 D008958 D008968 D009994 D013056", "score": 12.848591, "rank": 5506, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

When activated, the receptor is permeable to K+ and Na+, but not to Cl- ions. Measurement of Er in Tris+-substituted, Na-free medium also indicated a permeability to Tris+ ions. Unlike adult frog muscle the magnitude of Er was insensitive to change in external Ca++ (up to 30 mM) or to changes in external pH (between 6.4 and 8.9). The equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries (EK and ENa) and their respective conductances (gK and gNa), which has been generally useful in describing the Er of adult rat and frog muscle, could also be applied to rat myotubes when Er was measured over a wide range of external Na+ concentrations. The equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to myotubes bathed in media of different external K+ concentrations. In this case, the Er was more closely described by the Goldman constant field equation. Under certain circumstances, it is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to that described by the Goldman equation.

Sixty-three women with chronic essential hypertension were studied sequentially throughout pregnancy and two groups of patients were defined on the basis of clinical outcome and serial measurements of vascular reactivity to exogeneously administered A-II. The first group consisted of 29 gravidas with chronic hypertension alone and the second group was composed of 34 patients with chronic hypertension who were destined to develop superimposed PIH. Vascular resistance to infused A-II (more than 7 ng. per kilograms per minute required to increase diastolic blood pressure 20 mm.

Investigation of the roles of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase in the actions of phenylephrine in isolated hepatocytes.", "abstract": "The effects of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine on the levels of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells were studied. Cyclic AMP was very slightly (5 to 13%) increased in cells incubated with phenylephrine at a concentration (10(-5) M) which was maximally effective on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, the increase was significant only at 5 min. Cyclic AMP levels with 10(-5) M phenylephrine measured at this time were reduced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but were unaffected by the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine, indicating that the elevation was due to weak beta activity of the agonist. When doses of glucagon, epinephrine, and phenylephrine which produced the same stimulation of glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis were added to the same batches of cells, there were marked rises in cAMP with glucagon, minimal increases with epinephrine, and little or no changes with phenylephrine, indicating that the two catecholamine stimulated these processes largely by mechanisms not involving cAMP accumulation. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of homogenates of liver cells revealed two major peaks of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These eluted at similar salt concentrations as the type I and II isozymes from rat heart. Optimal conditions for preservation of hormone effects on the activity of the enzyme in the cells were determined. High concentrations of phenylephrine (10(-5) M and 10(-4) M) produced a small increase (10 tp 16%) in the activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) of the enzyme. This was abolished by propranolol, but not by phenoxybenzamine, indicating that it was due to weak beta activity of the agonist. The increase in the activity ratio of the kinase with 10(-5) M phenylephrine was much smaller than that produced by a glycogenolytically equivalent dose of glucagon. The changes in protein kinase induced by phenylephrine and the blockers and by glucagon were thus consistent with those in cAMP. Theophylline and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, which inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase, potentiated the effects of phenylephrine on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The potentiations were blocked by phenoxybenzamine, but not by propranolol. Methylisobutylxanthine increased the levels of cAMP and enhanced the activation of protein kinase in cells incubated with phenylephrine. These effects were diminished or abolished by propanolol, but were unaffected by phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded from these data that alpha-adrenergic activation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells occurs by mechanisms not involving an increase in total cellular cAMP or activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

In this model the initiatory step of energy metabolism, in which the initial substrate S is activated at the expense of ATP molecule energy, is catalyzed by an oligomeric enzyme E dissociable at high ATP concentration to monomers E1. It is assumed that the steady state level of monomers E1 in the cell is maintained by constitutive synthesis of E1 molecules, which balances their continuous hydrolysis by proteases. The properties of the kinetic model were studied using a mathematical model which is a system of nonlinear differential equations describing the change with time of the total enzyme E concentration and the concentration of ATP. The main isoclines of this system can intersect in one, two or three points. The mathematical analysis shows that the kinetic model considered exhibits adaptive properties. A sharp increase of the ATPase activity in the model initiates a transient process which leads to a rise in the total enzyme E concentration and in the efficiency of energy metabolism. As a result, the concentration of ATP drops only slightly. The establishment of a new level of the enzyme E concentration may proceed in the oscillatory fashion.", "pmid": "861261", "mesh_set": "D000222 D000255 D004734 D004798 D007700 D008433 D008954", "score": 15.47156, "rank": 4343, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Introduction of a hydroxy group at the alpha-position of fatty acids abolished the inhibition, while the inhibition was enhanced by the presence of a hydroxy group located in an intermediate position of the chain. Branched chain fatty acids having a methyl group at the terminal showed much higher activity than the corresponding saturated straight chain fatty acids with the same number of carbons. With respect to the mechanism for inhibition, tridecanoate was found to inhibit acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase specifically without affecting the other reaction steps in the cholesterol synthetic pathway.

Excess substrate inhibition was competitive and observed both with donor (glutathione) and various acceptors (methionine, alanine, tryptophan) but not with arginine. Excess glutathione inhibition of transfer reaction is concomitant with an increase of total reaction (transfer + hydrolysis + autotranspeptidation). With regard to aminoacids, the greater the K'm the stronger the inhibition. This inhibition is the result of formation of a dead complex. Lineweaver-Burk plots 1/v versus 1/[acceptor] give straight lines meeting at the same point, whereas 1/v verus 1/[donor] plots are roughly parallel for high aminoacid concentrations and become secant for the low ones. Replots of slopes vs. 1/[acceptor] are not linear: the lower the aminoacid affinity the more pronounced the slope replot curvature. Thus kinetic patterns are consistent with a branched ping-pong mechanism including a ternary complex (Enzyme-acceptor-H2O) at high or low relative concentration, which balances the two branches.

The concentrations of mid-brain tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptamine were also reduced in various brain regions examined.5 Withdrawal from diazepam or bromazepam therapy further augmented the levels of brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.6 The results demonstrate that the depressant effects on behaviour of these agents are accompanied by increased metabolism of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain.

The results of this study indicate that the effect of PGE2 on LH release is not mediated by adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic receptors.

A mathematical model.", "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of uric acid between fetal and maternal compartments in the term pregnant rhesus monkey. In 3 different animals 14C-labeled uric acid was injected into the fetal circulation, the amniotic fluid and the maternal circulation, respectively. In one experiment no uric acid was administered and the fetus was deliberately killed at the beginning of the experiment. Samples of fetal and maternal blood, maternal urine and amniotic fluid were collected at regular intervals. Semilogarithmic time-activity curves were constructed and time constants were determined. An open four-compartment model (fetal-placental plasma, fetal-placental interstitial space, amniotic fluid and maternal plasma) was applied to describe the intercompartmental dynamics of uric acid. Transplacental clearance was approx. 1 ml X min-1 in both directions, maternal renal clearance was about 17 ml X min-1. These results and the calculated values of the other intercompartmental clearances support earlier results, obtained with the steady infusion method. Uric acid concentrations in amniotic fluid and fetal plasma appeared to increase significantly during the experiments. The rise in amniotic fluid levels can only be explained by accepting a yet undefined compartment in which uric acid is produced and cleared directly into the amniotic cavity. It is speculated that this additional compartment could be the fetal lung.", "pmid": "264166", "mesh_set": "D000653 D000818 D001692 D005260 D008253 D008431 D008433 D008954 D010920 D011247 D011270 D014527", "score": 18.915014, "rank": 2665, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The influence of ouabain on net Ca movements was studied in human erythrocyte ghosts by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. 2. Ouabain (10(-5) M) showed a dual effect, altering both entry and exit of Ca from K-rich ghosts incubated in a high-Na medium in the presence of 10 mM-Ca. 3. Stimulation of Ca entry was observed in the first 15 min at 37 degrees C, whereas during the subsequent 15 min incubation ouabain elicited Ca extrusion. This latter effect was eliminated when the ouabain concentration was raised to 1 mM. 4. Ouabain-dependent Ca movements were abolished by replacing both internal K and external Na with choline. They were also absent from ghosts prepared at a high lytic ratio (1 : 100) or obtained from ATP-depleted cells. 5. A moderate increase in cell ATP enhanced the effect of ouabain on Ca efflux whilst it was eliminated at higher ATP levels. 6. The actions of ouabain markedly depended on the initial ADP/ATP ratio in ghosts, being optimal at about 2-5. 7. The results suggest that the effects of ouabain on Ca movements are mediated through the Na pump.

Its activity could be destroyed by pronase. 2) For elucidation of the subcellular localization of the activator, rat liver was fractionated by differential centrifugation. The intracellular distribution of the cerebroside sulphatase activator was compared to the distribution patterns of marker enzymes for different cell organelles and found to coincide with the lysosomal arylsulphatase, thus indicating a lysosomal localization. 3) This was confirmed using highly purified secondary, i.e. iron-loaded, lysosomes. After disruption by osmotic shock, these organelles hydrolyzed cerebroside sulphate when incubations were performed under physiological conditions with endogenous as well as exogenous sulphatase A as enzyme. 4) After subfractionation of the disrupted secondary lysosomes into membrane and lysosol fractions by high speed centrifugation, it was found that the activator protein was exclusively associated with the lysosol, whereas the acid hydrolases were distributed differently between the two fractions. 5) The lysosol was further fractionated by semi-preparative electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Two protein fractions were obtained: a high molecular weight fraction, containing the activator-free acid hydrolases, and a low molecular weight fraction, containing the enzyme-free activator of cerebroside sulphatase. 6) The significance of these findings for the hydrolysis of sphingolipids in the lysosomes is discussed.", "pmid": "10246", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002553 D004789 D006867 D007501 D008099 D008247 D008297 D008566 D011092 D011506 D051381 D013429", "score": 22.617334, "rank": 1475, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

One micron thick autoradiographs were compared between such experimental and control littermates having received the same number of syngeneic adult BN cells. Both experimental and control animals received tritiated deoxythymidine (3HdT) one hour before killing. The autoradiographs revealed a 2.25 and 2.50 times higher thymidine labeling index of lymphocytes in the deep cortex of mesenteric lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen, respectively, for experimental animals. The experimental effect occurred within one day. The majority of the labeled cells in experimental animals were large lymphoblasts with prominent nucleoli. The labeling index within these areas remained significantly higher than control values until day 8 in the spleen and through day 14 within the lymph nodes. However, differences in labeled cells present in high powered microscopic fields reached a peak on day 3 within compartments in experimental animals but fell significantly below control values by day 9 owing to a pronounced disappearance of both small and large lymphocytes from these areas, and a decreased intensity of individual cell labeling as the reaction progressed. In contradistinction the concentration of labeled cells present in high powered microscopic fields of lymph nodes' medulla became 3.13 times controls by day 4. Most of these labeled cells contained a more basophilic cytoplasm than those found in the deep cortex and some were distinctly plasma cell precursors. In contrast to the deep cortex their concentration remained approximately three times control values until death. The data indicates that the major proliferative events within the spleen and lymph nodes in neonatal rat GVHD are initially restricted to donor cell localization areas of these tissue compartments. Subsequently the GVHD-related events may be attributed to other areas and possibly cell types.

The uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p-triflouromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP), drastically reduced both the delta pH and the NTP level. When the cells were previously treated with DCCD, FCCP collapsed the delta pH while the NTP levels remained high. It is concluded that ATP produced by glycolysis is hydrolyzed by the membrane ATPase to generate a delta pH and that FCCP stimulates ATP hydrolysis by ATPase and collapses the proton gradient.", "pmid": "27785", "mesh_set": "D000693 D002259 D004024 D004099 D004734 D004926 D005635 D006019 D006863 D009682 D009711 D010710", "score": 13.341267, "rank": 5326, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Enzymologic and spectrophotometric properties.", "abstract": "2-Nitropropane dioxygenase, purified to homogeneity from Hansenula mrakii (IFO 0895), has a molecular weight of approximately 62,000 and consists of two subunits nonidentical in molecular weight (39,000 and 25,000). Stoichiometrical studies and the results obtained with 18O2 showed that 2 atoms of molecular oxygen are incorporated into 2 molecules of acetone formed from 2-nitropropane. In addition to 2-nitropropane, nitroethane, 3-nitro-2-pentanol, and 1-nitropropane are oxidatively dentrified. The enzyme, which exhibits absorption maxima at 274, 370, 415, and 440 nm and a shoulder at 470 nm, contains 1 mol of FAD and 1 g atom of non-heme iron per mol of enzyme. The enzyme-bound FAD is reduced by 2-nitropropane under anaerogic conditions, but the enzyme-bound Fe3+ is not affected. The introduction of oxygen to the reduced form of enzyme causes reoxidation of the enzyme. The bound FAD and Fe3+ are reduced by the addition of nitromethane, which is not a substrate, under anaerobic conditions. The aerobic dialysis of the enzyme treated with nitromethane causes reoxidation of only the Fe2+. Sodium dithionite also reduces both the enzyme-bound FAD and Fe3+ under anaerobic conditions. When the enzyme is dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) immediately after reduction by dithionite, the absorption spectrum similar to that of the native enzyme appeared with concomitant restoration of approximately 80% of the activity. The enzyme activity is significantly inhibited by pyrocatechol-3,5-disulfonate disodium salt, 8-hydroxyquinoline, reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and HgCl2.

The optimum conditions for the assay of mouse parotid guanylate cyclase have been established and using this procedure the properties of the enzyme have been investigated. The enzyme was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions. The particulate enzyme was activated 12-fold by Triton X-100 and the supernatant enzyme activity increased 2-fold. In the presence of detergent guanylate cyclase activity was distributed 85% in the particulate and 15% in the supernatant fractions, respectively. The particulate activity was localised in a plasma membrane fraction. Guanylate cyclase activity was also assayed in a wide variety of other tissues. In all cases enzymatic activity was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions. The distribution varied with the tissue but only the intestinal mucosa had a greater proportion of total guanylate cyclase activity in the particulate fraction than the parotid. The two enzymes showed some similar properties. Their pH optima were pH 7.4, both enzymes were inhibited by ATP, dATP, dGTP and ITP, required Mn2+ for activity and plots of activity versus Mn2+ concentration were sigmoidal. However, in many properties the enzymes were dissimilar. The ratios of Mn2+ to GTP for optimum activity were 4 and 1.5 for the supernatant and plasma-bound enzymes, respectively. The slope of Hill plots for the supernatant enzyme with varying Mn2+ was 2. The particulate enzyme plots also had a slope of 2 at low Mn2+ concentration but at higher concentrations (above 0.7 mM) the Hill coefficient shifted abruptly to 4. Calcium ions reduced sigmoidicity of the kinetics lowering the Hill coefficient, activated the enzyme at all Mn2+ concentrations but had no effect on the Mn2+:GTP ratio with the supernatant enzyme while with the plasma membrane enzyme Ca2+ had no effect on the sigmoid form of the kinetics at low Mn2+ but prevented the shift to a greater Hill coefficient at higher Mn2+, inhibited the activity at low Mn2+ and shifted the Mn2+:GTP optimum ratio to 4.

In this system the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase is induced by glucagon, (10(-6) to 10(-8) M) hydrocortisone (10(-5) to 10(-8) M), and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) (10(-4) to 10(-5) M). Epinephrine (10(-4) M) induces the enzyme only in the presence of hydrocortisone. Addition of actinomycin D inhibited the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by hydrocortisone and cAMP. Maintenance of the cultured hepatocytes in the presence of glucose (3g/liter) results in partial suppression of the inducing effects of glucagon and cAMP. Cyclic quanosine 3':5'-monophosphate does not mimic the effects of glucose. These results demonstrate that the phenomenon of glucose repression of enzyme induction, demonstrated in vivo in mammalian liver, is independent of changes in levels of serum hormones, which occur in vivo as a result of glucose administration.

{"title": "Calcium-regulating hormones during the menstrual cycle.", "abstract": "Calcium metabolism during the menstrual cycle was studied in seven women from whom fasting blood samples were drawn daily or every other day throughout ovulatory cycles. Total calcium (Ca), ionic calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), and immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin (CT) were measured. LH levels were used to date each cycle and progesterone levels were used to confirm ovulation. Plasma estradiol was measured in two of the subjects. In six subjects with cycle lengths of 27-31 days, PTH levels rose progressively through the follicular phase to a peak at or slightly before the LH surge, then fell progressively through the luteal phase; peak PTH levels were 30-35% above early follicular and late luteal values. CT levels were also highest at midcycle, but the CT pattern was somewhat more variable than that of PTH. Ca++ tended to fall until 3-4 days before ovulation and then to increase, while Ca, Mg, and P exhibited no particular pattern. One subject experienced a prolonged (44 day) ovulatory cycle characterized by three distinct PTH peaks, each of which coincided with elevations in plasma estradiol level. These results represent the first report of menstrual cyclicity in calcium-regulating hormones. The timing suggest an estrogen effect and it is hypothesized that estrogen inhibits PTH-induced bone resorption, lowering serum Ca++, which in turn provokes a compensatory PTH output. With the decline of the preovulatory estrogen peak, Ca++ levels rise and PTH secretion falls. Alternatively, it is possible that the primary action may be an estrogen-induced rise in CT release, causing hypocalcemia and consequent PTH output. Cyclic changes in PRL release or vitamin D metabolism might also be involved.", "pmid": "263315", "mesh_set": "D002116 D002118 D004958 D005260 D006801 D008274 D008598 D010060 D010281 D010710", "score": 12.640615, "rank": 5575, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

With lidocaine and procaine, increasing external pH (pHo) changed the time constant from long to short, but alterations of internal pH have no effect. Inactivation in Na channels was measured by the influence of prepulses on peak INa during test pulses. Single-stimulus inactivation curves were shifted more with lidocaine at high pHo than at low pHo, but inactivation curves measured during pulse trains with any of the drugs and at any pHo were strongly shifted. All measurements show that the drug-receptor reaction was slow for amine drugs at low pHo, as for quaternary drugs at any pHo, and fast for amine drugs at high pHo, as for neutral drugs at any pHo. The major effect of low pHo on amine drugs was to reduce the concentration of drugs in the fiber and to protonate drug molecules on the receptor, thus trapping them in the blocking position for a longer time.

Reducing the bathing calcium concentration ([Ca2+]0) with or without ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (EGTA) prolongs the action potential (AP). The change in the duration of the AP extends over many minutes, but is rapidly reversed by restoring calcium ions. Other changes (e.g., in resting potential and overshoot) are, however, only more slowly reversed. Reducing [Ca2+]0 with 0.2, 2, or 5 mM EGTA produces progressively greater prolongation of AP; maximum values were well in excess of 1 min. This prolongation can be reversed by other divalent cations in EGTA (Mg2+, Sr2+) or Ca-free (Mn2+) solutions, or by acetylcholine. Barium ions increase AP duration in keeping with their known effect on potassium conductance. D600, which blocks the slow inward current in cardiac muscle, is without effect on the action potentials recorded in EGTA solutions, or on the time course and extent of the recovery to normal duration upon restoring calcium ions.

These extracts gelled on warming to 25 degrees Celsius and contracted in response to micromolar Ca++ or a pH in excess of 7.0. Optimal gelation occurred in a solution containing 2.5 mM ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (EGTA), 2.5 mM piperazine-N-N'-bis [2-ethane sulfonic acid] (PIPES), 1 mM MgC1(2), 1 mM ATP, and 20 mM KCI at ph 7.0 (relaxation solution), while micromolar levels of Ca++ inhibited gelation. Conditions that solated the gel elicited contraction of extracts containing myosin. This was true regardless of whether chemical (micromolar Ca++, pH >7.0, cytochalasin B, elevated concentrations of KCI, MgC1(2), and sucrose) or physical (pressure, mechanical stress, and cold) means were used to induce solation.

During Ca++-or pH-elicited contraction: (a) actin, myosin, and a 95,000-dalton polypeptide were concentrated in the contracted extract; (b) the gelation activity was recovered in the material sqeezed out the contracting extract;(c) electron microscopy demonstrated that the number of free, recognizable F-actin filaments increased; (d) the actomyosin MgATPase activity was stimulated by 4- to 10-fold. In the absense of myosin the Dictyostelium extract did not contract, while gelation proceeded normally. During solation of the gel in the absense of myosin: (a) electron microscopy demonstrated that the number of free, recognizable F- actin filaments increased; (b) solation-dependent contraction of the extract and the Ca++-stimulated MgATPase activity were reconstituted by adding puried Dictyostelium myosin. Actin purified from the Dictyostelium extract did not gel (at 2 mg/ml), while low concentrations of actin (0.7-2 mg/ml) that contained several contaminating components underwent rapid Ca++ regulated gelation. These results indicated : (a) gelation in Dictyostelium extracts involves a specific Ca++-sensitive interaction between actin and several other components; (b) myosin is an absolute requirement for contraction of the extract; (c) actin-myosin interactions capable of producing force for movement are prevented in the gel, while solation of the gel by either physical or chemical means results in the release of F-actin capable of interaction with myosin and subsequent contraction.

{"title": "Lithium-induced impairment of urine acidification.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the means by which lithium induced a disorder of urine acidification. Rats infused with hydrochloric acid (1 mEq/kg) developed acute metabolic acidosis (blood Ph = 7.32; bicarbonate, 18 mEq/liter) with a urine pH of approximately 5.85. The addition of lithium chloride (4 mEq/kg i.p) caused an increase in the urine pH (6.38) and a further decrease in blood bicarbonate (11.0 mEq/liter). During bicarbonate loading, lithium caused the urine PCO2 to fall significantly (urine minus blood PCO2 decreased from 25.3 +/-2.8 To 14.4 +/- 2.3 mm Hg) These changes were not seen following equimolar i.p. administration of sodium chloride. Similarly, lithium  administration depressed bicarbonate reabsorption by 11.1% (from 30.6 to 27.2muEq/ml of GFR) during alkali infusion, while saline caused only a 5% decrease (30.0 to 28.5muEq/ml of GFR). The combination of an increase in urine PCO2 in alkaline urine indicates that lithium produced a defect in distal nephron hydrogen ion secretion. The fall in bicarbonate reabsorption following lithium administration oculd be due to a mild hydrogen ion secretory defect located in the proximal tubule or a severe defect in the distal nephron.", "pmid": "7708", "mesh_set": "D000137 D000138 D000141 D000818 D001639 D005919 D006863 D007687 D008094 D008297 D010710 D051381 D012965", "score": 11.756209, "rank": 5823, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Factors affecting the amount and the activity of the glutamate dehydrogenases of Coprinus cinereus.", "abstract": "Kinetic analyses done with cell-free extracts of this basidiomycete fungus showed that the NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase exhibited positively co-operative interactions with the substrates 2-oxoglutarate and NADPH, negatively co-operative kinetics with NADP+ and was extremely sensitive to inhibition of deamination activity by ammonium and/or ammonia. The NAD-linked enzyme showed positive co-operativity with NADH, Michaelis-Menten kinetics with all other substrates and was subject only to mild inhibitions by the reaction products. Considered together with the values of the Michaelis constants, these results indicate that the former enzyme is primarily concerned with the amination of 2-oxoglutarate when the concentration of this substrate exceeds about 4 mM, while the NAD-linked enzyme is able to aminate or deaminate as metabolic conditions require. Synthesis of both enzymes was repressed by addition of carbamyl phosphate or N-acetyl-glutamate to mycelial cultures growing in media containing glucose and ammonium as carbon and nitrogen sources. Growth in media containing urea results in repression of the NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase and derepression of the NAD-linked enzyme. Such results indicate a connexion between the glutamate dehydrogenases and the urea cycle. It is suggested that under normal conditions of growth on complex media nitrogen is assimilated in the form of amino acids and that the glutamate dehydrogenases act in support of transaminases to allow this process to continue, and in support of the urea cycle to allow the disposal of excess nitrogen.", "pmid": "13862", "mesh_set": "D000363 D000494 D000641 D003302 D003470 D004789 D004790 D004794 D005969 D005971 D007656 D007700 D009243 D009249 D014508", "score": 17.854065, "rank": 3125, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The ribonuclease activity in the fully derepressed state extends to about 60 to 100 fold of that in the repressed state. The synthesis of the ribonuclease was inhibited by the addition of rifampicin, cycloheximide or orthophosphate. Three molecular species of the ribonuclease were found. Two enzyme fractions showing larger molecular weights were suspected to be aggregates containing the enzyme showing the smallest molecular weight (molecular weight of 10 300). All three fractions showed pH optima of around 7, preferential hydrolysis of polyguanylic acid and poor hydrolysis of guanosine 2',3',-cyclic monophosphate. These characteristics were the same as those of ribonuclease N1, and it was suggested that ribonuclease N1 is a repressible extracellular enzyme. Mutations in the genes nuc-1 and nuc-2 caused loss of ability to derepress this enzyme, but heterokaryon between them partially restored the ability.

{"title": "Characteristics of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases of normal and leukemic lymphocytes.", "abstract": "The specific activity of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase of leukemic lymphocytes was 5-10-fold greater than that of purified normal lymphocytes or of homogenates of spleen, thymus or lymph nodes of normal mice. This rise was demonstrable over a wide range of substrate concentrations. Both normal and leukemic lymphocytes contained a heat-stable, calcium-dependent activator of phosphodiesterase. However, the increased activity of phosphodiesterase in leukemic lymphocytes was not due to this protein activator since (a) phosphodiesterase activity from these cells was not stimulated by this activator and (b) phosphodiesterase activity of leukemic lymphocytes was not inhibited by the calcium chelater, ethylene-glycol-bis,(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, suggesting that the enzyme was not already maximally activated. A comparison of several other properties of phosphodiesterase from normal and leukemic lymphocytes showed that the enzymes have similar pH optima, similar stabilities to freezing and thawing and similar sensitivities to inhibition by the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, chlorpromazine, papaverine and isobutylmethylxanthine. However, the subcellular distribution of the phosphodiesterases was different, and the phosphodiesterase of leukemic lymphocytes was significantly more resistant to heat than that of normal lymphocytes. Although no differences were found between the phosphodiesterases of normal and leukemic lymphocytes in their sensitivities to drugs, there were marked differences in drug sensitivity between the phosphodiesterase of lymphocytes and that of other tissue. For example, concentrations of chlorpromazine which inhibited phosphodiesterase of cerebrum by 70% had no effect on phosphodiesterase activity of lymphocytes. On the othere hand, the papaverine-induced inhibition of phosphodiesterase was similar in lymphocytes and cerebrum. Since an optimal concentration of cyclic nucleotides is essential to maintain normal cell growth, these results suggest that the abnormal growth characteristics of leukemic lymphocytes may be explained by their high activity of phosphodiesterase. Furthermore, the qualitative and quantitiative differences between the phosphodiesterases of leukemic lymphocytes and other tissues raise the possibility of selectively inhibiting the phosphodiesterase of the leukemic lymphocytes, thereby reducing their rate of growth, without affecting other tissues.", "pmid": "14711", "mesh_set": "D015105 D000818 D002460 D006152 D004355 D004789 D005260 D006863 D007942 D008214 D008221 D051379 D010727 D013045 D013347", "score": 16.262589, "rank": 3954, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

These variables were determined by pharmacokinetic analysis, measuring the decrease in serum concentration of tylosin activity in 3 separate experiments. Tylosin, given as a single intravenous dose of 10 mg of tylosin activity/kg of body weight, was calculated to have an elimination half life (t1/2beta) of 54 minutes and was no longer detectable in the serum by assay methods at about 270 minutes. In addition, tylosin appeared to be highly distributed with an apparent volume of distribution of about 1.7 L/kg and a tissue-to-plasma ratio of about 0.7. The body clearance of tylosin was calculated to be about 22 ml/kg minute. A separate multiple-dose intravenous experiment with the same dose per injection was conducted and showed similar results. Also, single intramuscular injection of 10 mg of tylosin activity/kg showed tylosin to peak after injection in the serum at 30 minutes, attaining a concentration of approximately 1.5 mug/ml. This concentration was maintained through 60 minutes and decreased slowly through 540 minutes. Data generated through 17 clinical cases indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentration for tylosin in Pasteurella spp tested was about 6.25 mcs/ml and for hemolytic Staphylococcus spp tested greater than or equal to 0.4 mug/ml. Thus, it would appear that tylosin, given at the recommended dose (6.6 to 11.0 mg tylosin activity/kg of body weight once or twice per day), would produce serum levels insufficient to treat all Pasteurella spp and some hemolytic Staphylococcus spp tested since a serum level of tylosin at slightly higher than 1 mug/ml for about 30 minutes was achieved in this study.", "pmid": "842925", "mesh_set": "D000818 D000900 D004285 D005260 D007273 D007275 D007933 D008297", "score": 14.782165, "rank": 4715, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

After practolol cyclic-AMP concentration and PRA decreased about 20% compared with the basal value within 10 min. The stimulating effect of subsequently applied furosemide on PRA was not altered, but the cyclic-AMP concentration was not changed in this time by furosemide.

The cyclic-AMP concentration was not influenced by the following furosemide application, in agreement with the findings after practolol, however, PRA could be stimulated only in 36% of these patients under beta-receptor blockade. Our results show that changes of the concentrations of cyclic-AMP and of PRA are independent of each other. An elevated intracellular cyclic-AMP level due to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase is as a single factor unable to stimulate renin release. Our results give no evidence of a direct involvement of the adenylcyclase-system in the mechanism of renin release.

The yield of cells was constant at pH 6.5 and 6.0 (2.00 mg/ml) but fell to 1.25 at pH 5.5; Y(glucose) was relatively constant under all conditions. Lactic acid was the major end product. Amino acid analysis of the culture supernatants indicated that growth was probably limited by the availability of cysteine. Cells were harvested and monitored for their capacity to produce acid from endogenous polysaccharide and exogenous sugars in the presence and absence of NaF, as well as for their glucose phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-phosphotransferase activity. Surprisingly, cells grown at pH 5.5 possessed two to three times more glycolytic activity, as measured by the rate of acid production, than cells grown at pH 6.5 and 6.0 when incubated in a washed suspension at constant pH with a sugar source. Furthermore, the cells grown at pH 5.5 were about twice as resistant to the effect of NaF in reducing the rate of acid production in this system. Fluoride inhibition could be reversed by increasing the pH of the system. Cells grown at all three pH values showed significant acid production from endogenous reserves, despite the fact that the glucoamylase-specific glycogen content of the cells dropped from 33% of the total carbohydrate during pH 6.5 growth to only 3% after growth at pH 6.0 and 6.5. Incubation of washed cells for 18 h in phosphate buffer resulted in the loss of 62% of the total carbohydrate, indicating that nonglycogen cellular polysaccharide was metabolized. A comparison of the fluoride effect on endogenous and exogenous metabolism under pH fall conditions showed that, with pH 6.5- and 6.0-grown cells, the inhibitor was more effective in the presence of an exogenous carbon source than in its absence. This effect was not seen with pH 5.5-grown cells. The decreased sensitivity of the pH 5.5-grown cells to fluoride was probably associated with the decreased glucose PEP-phosphotransferase activity (11%) in these cells compared with the activity of those grown at pH 6.5.

While the native enzyme exhibited a marked negative Cotton effect centered at 233 +/- 1 nm in optical rotatory dispersion, the enzyme denatured in 4 M guanidine-HCl retained little optical activity. Upon dilution of the denatured enzyme, however, more than 90% of the ordered structure was recovered in 1 min, while the restoration of the activity proceeded much more slowly. Estimation of molecular weights by gel permeation chromatography indicated that the tetrameric enzyme is subject to reversible dissociation into monomeric subunits under the experimental conditions. Various environmental factors such as temperature, pH and protein concentration exhibited profound influence on the rate and extent of the reactivation. In order to examine the correlation between the restoration of the activity and the quaternary structure, electron microscopic inspection of the kinetic processes of reversible denaturation was attempted. Upon dilution of the denatured enzyme at 4 degrees C, neither the activity nor tetrameric images were detected over several min. Upon the temperature shift up to 25 degrees C, however, the activity regain was rapidly proceeded concomitant with the appearance of tetrameric molecules.

Recovery of rapidly sedimenting endoplasmic reticulum in association with mitochondria.", "abstract": "Low-speed centrifugation (640 g) of rat liver homogenates, prepared with a standard ionic medium, yielded a pellet from which a rapidly sedimenting fraction of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RSER) was recovered free of nuclei. This fraction contained 20-25% of cellular RNA and approximately 30% of total glucose-6-phosphatase (ER marker) activity. A major portion of total cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondrial marker) activity was also recovered in this fraction, with the remainder sedimenting between 640 and 6,000 g. Evidence is provided which indicates that RSER may be intimately associated with mitochondria. Complete dissociation of ER from mitochondria in the RSER fraction required very harsh conditions. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis revealed that 95% dissociation could be achieved when the RSER fraction was first resuspended in buffer containing 500 mM KCl and 20 mM EDTA, and subjected to shearing. Excluding KCl, EDTA, or shearing from the procedure resulted in incomplete separation. Both electron microscopy and marker enzyme analysis of mitochondria purified by this procedure indicated that some structural damage and leakage of proteins from matrix and intermembrane compartments had occurred. Nevertheless, when mitochondria from RSER and postnuclear 6,000-g pellet fractions were purified in this way fromanimals injected with [35S]methionine +/- cycloheximide, mitochondria from the postnuclear 6,000-g pellet were found to incorporate approximately two times more cytoplasmically synthesized radioactive protein per milligram mitochondrial protein (or per unit cytochrome c oxidase activity) than did mitochondria from the RSER fraction.

This PCA blocking assay was used to measure the 'binding' of IgE to intact rat mast cells or to particulate preparations derived from mast cells. The PCA-blocking activity at pH 4.8 was up to 100-fold greater than that seen at a physiologic pH of 6.6.

Transport of glucose, as measured in ATP-depleted cells, was pH-dependent to the same extent as transport of the non-metabolizable sugars. 3. Glucose consumption rates were about 8-fold higher at pH 8.5 than at pH 6.4. About 65-85% of glucose was converted into lactate. Sugar transport rates were 2.5-fold higher at pH 8.5 than at pH 6.3. 4. pH affected both simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. pH effect was mainly on the Vmax. of 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and on the rapid-uptake phase of 3-O-methylglucose transport. 5.

These substances in doses 20-160 times higher than their ED50 in head twitch test did not antagonize the pinna reflex. 5-MT-induced head twitches were also inhibited by imipramine, morphine, phenoxybenzamine and aceperone. However, their ED50 were only 3-8 times below the doses necessary to inhibit the pinna reflex. Reserpine, phentolamine, spiroperidol, pimozide and LiCl did not modify head twitches produced by 5-MT, while PCPA even potentiated them. Our results suggest the 5-MT-induced head twitches are due to the activation of the central 5-HT mechanisms probably as a result of direct stimulation of 5-HT receptors by 5-MT.

The results were compared with the passive ionic conductances calculated from the branched equivalent circuit membrane model of Hodgkin Huxley. Ionic permeabilities for potassium, sodium, and chloride of crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) medial giant axons were examined over an external pH range from 3.8 to 11.4. Action potentials were obtained over this pH range. Failures occurred below pH 3.8 during protonation of membrane phospholipid phosphate and carboxyl, and above pH 11.4 from calcium precipitation. In general, chloride permeability increases with membrane protonation, while cation permeability  decreases. At pH 7.0, PK = 1.33 X 10(-5), PCl = 1.49 X 10(-6), PNa = 1.92 X 10(-8) cm/s. PK: PCl: PNa = 693:78:1. PCl is zero above pH 10.6 and is opened predominately by protonation of epsilon-amino, and partially by tyrosine and sulfhydryl groups from pH 10.6 to 9. PK is activated in part by ionization of phospholipid phosphate and carboxyl around pH 4, then further by imidazole from pH 5 to 7, and then predominately from pH 7 to 9 by most probably phosphatidic acid. PNa permeability parallels that of potassium from pH 5 to 9.4. Below pH 5 and above pH 9.4, PNa increases while PK decreases.

{"title": "Ion-binding to phospholipids. Interaction of calcium with phosphatidylserine.", "abstract": "The binding of Ca2+ to monolayers and bilayers of phosphatidylserine has been investigated as a function of pH, ionic strength (NaCl concentration) and Ca2+ concentration using surface and colloid chemical techniques. The molar ratio of lipid to bound calcium decreases to 2 as the Ca2+ concentration is increased to about 0.1 mM. At [Ca2+] greater than 0.1 mM a 1:1 complex is formed. The apparent binding constant Ka ranges from about approximately 10(6) - 10(4) l/mol depending on the Ca2+ concentration. After allowing for electrostatic effects and neighbour group interactions, the intrinsic binding constant Ki of the phosphorylserine polar group at pH 7 (I = 0.01 M), where it carries a net negative charge of one, is approximately 10(4) l/mol; consistent values for Ki were obtained using several independent approaches. Ka for Ca2+ binding decreases with increasing NaCl concentration because the monovalent cations compete with Ca2+ for the same binding site. Na+ and K+ are equally effective in displacing 45Ca2+ adsorbed to monolayers of phosphatidylserine, both with respect to the kinetics and the equilibrium of the displacement. Ka for the reaction between phosphatidylserine and monovalent cations is about 10(3)-fold smaller than that of Ca2+. An investigation of the binding of Mn2+ to phosphatidylserine by both surface chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance methods shows that this cation has a similar binding constant to that of Ca2+. The Ca2+-binding capabilities of monolayers containing only carboxyl groups (i.e. arachidic acid) and phosphodiester groups (i.e. dicetyl phosphate) have also been determined; the apparent pK for the - COOH group in monolayers is larger than or equal to 9 and that for the phosphodiester group is less than 4. Since these groups do not retain the same pK values when they are in close proximity in the phosphorylserine group, the relative contributions of the two groups to the binding of Ca2+ to phosphatidylserine is not obvious.", "pmid": "3416", "mesh_set": "D001665 D002118 D004578 D006863 D008433 D008567 D008954 D008968 D009994 D010714 D010718 D012965 D013499", "score": 16.156958, "rank": 4012, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Study of the pulmonary circulation in a canine asthma model.", "abstract": "Measurements of respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, and pulmonary hemodynamics were made before and serially for 2 hours after inhalation challenge with Ascaris suum extract in dogs with natural sensitivity to this antigen. Nine of 14 dogs randomly exposed to an inspired oxygen fraction of 0.21 or 0.60 to 0.70, responded to the challenge with bronchospasm reflected by a transient decrease of mean specific respiratory system conductance to 50 per cent of baseline after 5 to 15 min. This was accompanied by a decrease in alveolar ventilation in all and acidosis in some animals. No changes were observed in transmural pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary blood volume in all 9 dogs who responded with bronchospasm, whether or not arterial hypoxemia was allowed to develop. In contrast, a significant increase in pulmonary vascular resistance occurred in control dogs in whom comparable degrees of arterial hypoxemia were produced by 10 per cent oxygen breathing or mechanical bronchial obstruction by placing beads in lobar and segmental airways. No changes in any parameter measured occurred in the 5 dogs who did not develop bronchospasm after antigen challenge. The results indicated that moderately severe, antigen-induced bronchospasm in anesthetized dogs has no effect on the pulmonary circulation even when associated with arterial hypoxemia. Because nonuniformity of alveolar hypoxia allowing redistribution of blood flow is probably not responsible for this failure to develop increases in pulmonary vascular resistance in induced asthma, it is suggested that the elaboration of chemical mediators may have interfered with the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response.", "pmid": "842939", "mesh_set": "D000138 D000281 D000818 D000941 D001200 D001249 D001784 D001810 D001986 D004195 D004285 D008170 D010100 D011652 D012119 D012129", "score": 12.230673, "rank": 5700, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Ten days postoperatively, VMH-lesioned rats had hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased blood urea nitrogen levels, together with decreased plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and glucose levels. Insulin release produced in vivo by a glucose load was much higher in VMH-lesioned than in control rats. Perfused livers from VMH-lesioned rats secreted more triglycerides and produced more urea than controls, whereas production of glucose and ketone bodies was reduced. Lipogenesis, newly synthesized triglyceride secretion, and the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase were greatest in livers from VMH-lesioned rats. Fasting abolished hyperinsulinemia and most of these observed metabolic alterations. After treatment with anti-insulin serum, the high rate of lipogenesis observed in livers from VMH-lesioned rats was restored toward normal.

The 24-hr LD50 of colchicine was relatively constant in rats over 25 days of age. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of the increased sensitivity of the newborn rat to the toxic action of colchicine, the distribution of 3H after the administration of 3H-colchicine (0.1 mg/kg) was measured in 10- and 35-day-old rats. The concentration of 3H was higher in all tissues of the newborn than the adult after ip administration, suggesting an immaturity in the pathway for colchicine elimination. After iv administration, radioactivity disappeared much more slowly from the plasma of the newborn rat than from the adult. This was due to a lower capacity of the liver of the newborn to concentrate colchicine and to excrete it into the bile. Development of the hepatic excretory mechanism responsible for excretion of colchicine occurred at the same age as did the increase in LD50. These results suggest that colchicine is more toxic in the newborn because the drug remains in the body for a longer time due to immaturity of the liver excretory process.", "pmid": "1230", "mesh_set": "D000367 D000818 D000831 D001646 D003078 D007928 D008099 D051381 D013997", "score": 21.542261, "rank": 1739, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Investigations on the kinetic properties of estrone glucuronyltransferase from pig kidney.", "abstract": "The microsomal fraction of the pig kidney catalyzes the glucuronidation of estrone in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid. This bireactant system exhibits a sequential type of reaction mechanism. Increasing concentrations of either substrate increase the affinity of the enzyme for the other substrate. The Hill coefficient, n, was calculated to be 1.0 for both estrone and UDP-glucuronic acid. The Kestrone and KUDP-glucuronic acid are 6.6 muM and 254 muM, respectively. The estrone glucuronyltransferase (UDP-glucuronate: 17 beta-oestradiol 3-glucuronosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.59) exhibits high substrate specificity in that it is inhibited noncompetetively by estradiol-17 beta, estradiol-17 alpha, estriol, testosterone, phenolphthalein and bilirubin; p-nitrophenol and o-aminophenol do not inhibit the glucuronidation of estrone. Mg2+ and Ca2+ were found to be nonessential activators. One of the two products of the reaction, estrone glucuronide, inhibits the enzyme competitively in the presence of increasing concentrations of UDP-glucuronic acid. The other product of the reaction, UDP, inhibits the enzyme noncompetitively with varying estrone concentrations and uncompetitively with varying UDP-glucuronic acid concentrations. Under incubation conditions for the glucuronidation of estrone, the enzyme catalyzes the reverse reaction with estrone glucuronide and UDP as reactants to an extent of about 0.4% of the forward reaction; this reverse reaction is also of a sequential type.", "pmid": "10996", "mesh_set": "D000255 D000818 D002413 D004958 D004964 D004970 D014453 D006863 D007668 D007700 D013439 D013552 D013696 D013739 D013816", "score": 21.464077, "rank": 1767, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Brain, liver, lung, kidney, and plasma were analyzed by a thin-layer chromatographic method. Following iv injection, the levels of CF3-PER were much higher in brain, lung, kidney, and plasma obtained from the aorta than following oral administration, whereas the metabolite concentrations were very similar after administration by the two routes. However, CF3-PER concentrations in liver did not depend upon the route of administration. In conjunction with this fact, the poor availability of CF3-PER in the central compartment and extrahepatic tissues following oral dosage points to a pronounced first-pass effect. When CF3-PER plasma levels were measured in the portal vein of orally treated rats, the amount of drug absorbed unchanged from the intestine could be demonstrated to be 91% of the dose. A high liver extraction (about 80%) was demonstrated in vivo by sampling hepatic venous blood. Pretreatment of rats with SKF 525-A led to an impaired CF3-PER elimination and to an increase in the liver/plasma ratio. This showed that the liver extraction was due to rapid biotransformation. Orally dosed rats exhibited significantly higher levels of CF3-PER and of its demethylation product in brain, lung, and kidney when they had been pretreated for 3 weeks with 12.3 micronmol of CF3-PER per kg daily po.

Both serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in MCT-fed rats showed significant decrease during the experimental period of eight weeks, although liver cholesterol and triglyceride contents were not distinguishable between the two groups. Significant elevation of the activity of lipogenic enzymes, such as fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and malic enzyme (ME) of the liver, was observed in MCT-fed rats without any fat accumulation of the liver (fatty liver). The increase of lipogenic enzyme activity was accompanied by a significant reduction of essential fatty acids (EFA) such as 18:2 (omega6) and 20:4 (omega6) in total liver lipid. In contrast, hepatic beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl CoA(HMG-CoA) reductase activity was significantly decreased in MCT-fed rats, that would play an important role in achieving hypocholesterolemia.

A protein (IF-3) has been purified from high salt (0.88 M KCI) extracts of native 40S subunits by gradient centrifugation and by ammonium sulfate fractionation; it prevents the reassociation of subunits and to a limited extent dissociates ribosomes to subunits. The activity is measured by ultracentrifugation of the reaction products on linear sucrose gradients, or with an assay developed in this laboratory that couples dissociation with the 60S-specific peptidyltransferase reaction; the latter procedure measures the amount of 60S subunits released from ribosomes or remaining in incubations in the presence of IF-3. Dissociation factor activity is recovered from most of the particles that are resolved by zonal centrifugation of the total \"native subunits\" obtained from the postmicrosomal fraction; the highest concentration of IF-3, however, appears to be associated with native 40S subunits. The purified dissociation factor IF-3 is composed of about ten polypeptides and the molecular weight is estimated to be between 500 000 and 700 000, on the basis of glycerol and cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. When purified 40S subunits react with IF-3 or when 80S ribosomes are dissociated by IF-3, a product is formed which is dependent on the concentration of the protein factor and has the characteristics of a 40SIF-3 complex; centrifugation of the complex on sucrose and cesium chloride gradients suggests that the complex consists of 1 equiv of each of the two components. Although dissociation factor IF-3 appears to react in a specific manner with free or ribosome-associated 40S subunits, the reaction with subunits differs in several respects from that with ribosomes. The dissociation factor also appears to interact with 60S subunits but multiple complexes are formed, some with more than 1 IF-3 equiv per 60S particle. The IF-3 converts 40S dimers (55S particles) to the 40S-IF-3 complex and dissociates free, native 80S particles present in the postmicrosomal fraction, but it does not affect polysome-associated ribosomes engaged in protein synthesis.", "pmid": "861207", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001665 D008099 D046911 D008274 D010448 D014176 D011691 D051381 D012270", "score": 18.785513, "rank": 2719, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The amount of shortening in the major axis and its derivative were measured to assess myocardial contractility. Both the 'respiratory' and 'metabolic' alterations affected the contractile behavior to the same extent. In the physiological range studied by us, acidosis depresses and alkalosis increases myocardial contraction. However acidosis seems to depress contractility more than the enhancement produced by the same change in pH towards the alkalotic side. When either amount of shortening or max dl/dt was plotted as a function of hydrogen ion acitvity (aH+) a linear correlation was obtained, either with pure 'metabolic' or 'respiratory' acid-base induced alterations (correlation coefficients higher than -.95; P less than .01).

{"title": "1-Alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate: acyl-CoA acyltransferase in rat brain microsomes.", "abstract": "1-Alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate:acyl-CoA acyltransferase activity was found in six rat tissues: heart, spleen, brain, kidney, liver, and lung. The enzyme in rat brain showed highest specific activity in the microsomal fraction and its properties were studied in detail. Triton X-100 and bovine serum albumin were found to stimulate the activity of the enzyme. It was found that Triton X-100 affects the acyltransferase activity differentially depending on the acyl-CoA donor. Albumin reversed the inhibition caused by a high concentration of 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate. The enzyme was shown to be stereospecific in acylating the alkylglycerophosphate substrate. Only the 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate isomer, not the other optical enantiomer, was active with brain acyltransferase. Evidence is presented to show that this enzyme is different from 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate:acyl-CoA acyltransferase. Investigations of the specificity of the brain acyltransferase activity for different acyl-CoA species (16:0, 18:0, 18:2, 20:4, 22:4, 22:6) showed a selectivity which was dependent on the alkylglycerophosphate concentration. At low 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate concentration the enzyme selected polyunsaturated acyl-CoA species over saturated species. Providing a low but continuous amount of 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate to the acyltransferase was accomplished by the in situ enzymatic reduction of alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate with NADPH in the incubation mixtures. The acyl composition of ether-containing phosphoglycerides in rat brain microsomes, as well as the free fatty acid composition, was determined. Alkenylacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine contains a high percentage of 22:6 ester, and alkenylacylglycerophosphorylcholine contains a large amount of 16:0 ester. Comparison of the acyl-CoA specificity of 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate acyltransferase and ether/glycerolipid acyl composition suggests that this acyltransferase could partially determine the composition of acyl groups in ether lipids.", "pmid": "838734", "mesh_set": "D000123 D000217 D000818 D001921 D005227 D005459 D005994 D007700 D008274 D008297 D008861 D009928 D010743 D011092 D051381", "score": 32.175694, "rank": 370, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "positive/labeled"}
{"title": "Effect of perfusion rate on the fluxes of water, sodium, chloride and urea across the proximal convoluted tubule.", "abstract": "Studies were undertaken to examine the mechanism whereby changes in intraluminal flow rates after reabsorption in the isolated perfused proximal tubule of the rabbit. All protocols employed the technique of in vitro perfusion of isolated segments of the proximal convoluted tubule. Stepwise elimination of d-glucose and l-alanine from an artifical perfusate stimulating ultrafiltrate decreased the unidirectional flux of sodium, transtubular potential difference, and net water absorption. Using isosmolal ultrafiltrate as the perfusate, net fluid reabsorption and the unidirectional lumen-to-bath flux of sodium and chloride decreased with a decrease in flow rate below 11 nl/min, but neither net fluid reabsorption nor the unidirectional fluxes of sodium and chloride increased further as the perfusion rate was increased above 11 nl/min. The unidirectional flux of 14C-urea was not affected by changes of perfusion rate from 1.6 to 44 nl/min. The dependence of net fluid reabsorption and unidirectional fluxes of sodium and chloride on flow rate per se, and not on intraluminal hydrostatic pressure or geometry, was established by demonstrating their decrease despite a rise in intraluminal pressure and inside diameter produced by counterpressure at the collecting end of the tubule, while flow was decreased. Ouabain decreased net fluid reabsorption to near zero at all flow rates, but ouabain had no effect on the flow-dependency of unidirectional sodium anf sodium was eliminated with a decrease in bicarbonate concentration and removal of d-glucose and l-alanine from the perfusate. Thus, the present studies demonstrate that net water and unidirectional sodium and chloride fluxes are flow-dependent. At flow rates somewhere below 11 nl/min, unidirectional fluxes decreased with decreasing perfusion rates; however, at perfusion rates greater than 11 nl/min, there was no further effect of perfusion rate on either net water absorption or the unidirectional fluxes of sodium or chloride. These effects may be partly mediated through the flow-dependent changes in the intraluminal concentration of bicarbonate, d-glucose, and 1-alanine.", "pmid": "839650", "mesh_set": "D000327 D000409 D000818 D001692 D001834 D002712 D005260 D005947 D006874 D066298 D007687 D010042 D010477 D011817 D012964 D014508", "score": 9.664171, "rank": 6079, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The rusults obtained indicate that the binding of phosphoenolpyruvate to the enzyme requires a phosphoryl group on the C-2 position of the substrate and one free hydrogen atom at the C-3 position. 3. The dead-end inhibition pattern observed with the substrate analogue 2-phosphoglycerate when either phosphoenolpyruvate or erythrose 4-phosphate was the variable substrate is inconsistent with a ping-pong mechanism and indicates that the reaction mechanism for this enzyme must be sequential.

A simultaneous elevation of the KM and Vmakc leads that the efficacy (E) of the uptake altered much less than the main parameters. The revealed dependency between the substrate concentration in the medium and the rate of noradrenaline uptake was apparently caused by the heterogeneity of the system reserving catecholamines in the medullary layer of the adrenal glands. It was shown that under the effect of phentholamine (2-5.10(-7) M) the alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, and propranolol (2-5.10(-7) M) the uptake of noradrenaline-3H by rat adrenal glands became activated.

An explanation for the increased cGMP immunofluorescence was sought in experiments in which guanylate cyclase [GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2]activity of hepatic subcellular fractions was determined. The results showed that a nuclear guanylate cyclase exists which can be distinguished from the soluble and crude particulate guanylate cyclases. The activity of the nuclear enzyme was increased by 35% in nuclei isolated from rats 30 min after glucagon injection, the time at which maximal nuclear membrane cGMP immunofluorescence is observed. Because glucagon altered both cAMP location and levels prior to the observed changes in nuclear cGMP metabolism, the hypothesis that cAMP acted as the second messenger was tested. In vitro incubation of nuclei isolated from control rats with 10(-5) M cAMP produced a 25% increase in nuclear guanylate cyclase activity. With nuclei isolated from glucagon-treated rats, no significant increase in enzyme activity was observed; this indicates that maximal stimulation of nuclear guanylate cyclase by cAMP occurred at levels that are obtained in vivo after glucagon administration.

{"title": "The non-convalent binding of small molecules by ligandin. Interactions with steroids and their conjugates, fatty acids, bromosulphophthalein carcinogens, glutathione and realted compounds.", "abstract": "1. Equilibrium dialysis studies have been made of the binding of a number of small molecules by rat ligandin. Direct measurements of binding together with competition experiments indicated that bromosulphophthalein, oestrone sulphate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate each bind at the same single primary binding site with association constants of 1.1 X 10(7), 6.6 X 10(5) and 2.6 X 10(5) 1/mol respectively at pH 7.0,IO.16M,4 degrees C. As well as bromosulphophthalein and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, a number of strucurally similar organic anions including 2-hydroxyoestradiol-glutathione oestrone glycyronide, N-methyl-4-aminoazobenzene-glutathione and several bile acids, were able to displace oestrone sulphate from ligandin in a manner consistent with competition at a single binding site. From these experiments association constants for the competing ligands were derived; these were inthe range 1 X 10(4)-1 X 10(6) 1/mol. 2. Ligandin was found to bind a number of compounds for which, because of their low aqueous solubilities relative to their binding affinities complete  binding isotherms could bot be obtained. These included several steroids (but not cortisol), 20-methylcholanthrene, diethylstilboestrol, oleate and palmitate. Oestrone sulphate was able to compete with these ligands for binding and the results of the competition experiments were interpretable in terms of 1:1 competition at a single binding site. 3. In general the conjugation of non-polar ligands with sulphate or glutathione resulted in increased affinities, but such increases were relatively small (approximately 15% in therms of free energy) implying that the main driving force for the binding of both the conjugated and unconjugated species was the hydrophobic effect. This conclusion is borne out by the observations that both oestrone and its sulphate showed slight increases in affinity with increase in ionic strength, as would be expected for hydrophobic interactions. 4. As well as non-polar compounds and organic anions, ligandin was also found to bind sulphate and glucuronate to a measurable degree, and to interact quite strongly with glutathione. For the latter compound a single binding site was found with an association constant of 1 X 10(5) 1/mol. Glutathione was able to cause the dissociation of the ligandin-oestrone sulphate complex, but this effect was not explicable in terms of simple 1:1 competition. 5. Both oestrone and oestrone sulphare were bound most strongly at pH 6-7, the affinity of the protein for these ligands falling off quite sharply on either side of this maximum. 6. The affinities of ligandin for bromosulphophthalein, steroids and their conjugates, diethylstilboestrol and N,N-dimethyl-4-aminoazobenzene are similar in magnitude to those of serum albumin and aminoazodye-binding protein A (B.

Binding of the labeled hormone is optimal at pH 7.0. In the absence of GTP, [3H]glucagon binding to receptors is slow and the time of equilibration is inversely proportional to the hormone concentration. In the presence of GTP, equilibrium is reached within 30 s regardless of hormone levels, and the kinetics of binding are in accord with the kinetics of activation of adenylate cyclase by native glucagon in the presence of the nucleotide. Equilibrium binding measurements indicate that, in the absence of GTP, the binding isotherm is sigmoidal with an apparent Kd of 2 nM. The addition of GTP results in a complex binding isotherm with about 90% of the binding sites having a considerably lower apparent dissociation constant (greater than 10 nM) and a small population of sites having high affinity for the hormone. The binding properties of [3H]glucagon are compared with those of 125I-glucagon, and the implications of the actions of GTP on glucagon binding are discussed in relation to the overall regulation of adenylate cyclase by hormone and the nucleotide.", "pmid": "16000", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001667 D002462 D005934 D006160 D006863 D007700 D008099 D051381 D011956", "score": 23.940851, "rank": 1200, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

[125I]HYP was bound rapidly and reversibly to isolated bovine parathyroid cell membranes. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of binding sites with high affinity (4 X 10(10M-1) and low capacity (0.7 pmol/mg). Saturation analysis of [125I]HYP binding to intact bovine parathyroid cells suggested a site with similar affinity on whole cells and with a binding capacity of 5000-10,000 sites/cell. True dissociation constants (Kd's) for beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists were in good agreement with activation constants (KA'S) and inhibition constants (KI'S) for effects on adenylate cyclase in membrane preparations. These constants also were in reasonable agreement with KA'S and KI'S previously shown for effects of agonists and antagonists on cAMP accumulation and PTH release in whole cells. This study shows by direct analysis that beta-adrenergic receptors exist on isolated bovine parathyroid cells, and that there is close coupling between receptor binding, effects on cAMP and hormonal release.

Sodium pentobarbital caused a dose-dependent increase in whole brain acetylcholine. A maximal increase of 81% in whole brain was seen at 15 minutes with 80 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital. The increase in acetylcholine after sodium pentobarbital treatment was not caused by anoxia from respiratory depression or by hypothermia. All brain regions except the cerebellum exhibited an increase in acetylcholine after pentobarbital treatment. Fifteen minutes after treatment, cerebellar acetylcholine was significantly decreased. However, at the time when half of the animals had regained the righting reflex, the unconscious mice showed an increase in cerebellar acetylcholine which was statistically significant  as compared to control. The relative accumulation rate of acetylcholine calculated for cerebral cortex and hippocampus was higher than that for striatum although the absolute rate of accumulation of ACh was higher in the striatum.

Mersalyl antagonized relaxation in response to serotonin whereas BOL and UML were less effective. Two other indole derivatives, ergotamine and gramine, were also blocked by mersalyl; BOL and UML antagonized relaxation in response to dopamine more effectively than did mersalyl. Two other catechols, epinephrine and norepinephrine, were also blocked more effectively by BOL and UML than by mersaly. Relaxation in response to neural stimulation was blocked more effectively by mersalyl than by BOL. The blocking action of mersalyl on neural relaxation reversed very poorly after washing the drug, but complete reversal was induced by brief exposure to dithiothreitol.

{"title": "Inhibition of intestinal iron absorption by laundry starch.", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of iron deficiency anemia associated with amylophagia is usually attributed to dietary iron lack. However, large quantities of starch may inhibit intestinal iron absorption. Accordingly, studies were carried out to determine the effect of laundry starch on the intestinal absorption of inorganic and hemoglobin iron. In vitro, laundry starch bound 19 to 80% of the available 59FeSO4 and 34 to 68% of the available 59Fe-hemoglobin. Binding of both forms of iron was pH-dependent, with maximal binding at pH 7.0. In vivo, laundry starch significantly inhibited mucosal uptake of 59FeSO4 from isolated duodenal loops. In nonanemic rats, administration of laundry starch (100 mg) 1 hr before a 100-mug dose of 59FeSO4 significantly decreased the absorption of 59FeSO4, as compared to saline or low iron chow controls (6.2 +/- 2.0 versus 14.9 +/- 2.1 and -1.8 +/- 1.7, respectively, P less than 0.001). In anemic rats the absorption of either a 100-mug dose of 59FeSO4 or a 500-mug dose of 59Fe-hemoglobin was also significantly decreased by prior administration of laundry starch. The data obtained indicated that laundry starch (1) binds appreciable quantities of inorganic and hemoglobin iron in vitro; (2) inhibits the mucosal uptake or inorganic iron by isolated intestinal loops; (3) inhibits the intestinal absorption of inorganic iron in normal nonanemic rats, and (4) blunts the compensatory increase in inorganic and organic iron absorption in anemic rats.", "pmid": "11141", "mesh_set": "D000747 D000818 D003864 D004386 D005260 D006454 D006801 D006863 D007408 D007501 D007504 D010842 D051381 D013213", "score": 14.520453, "rank": 4847, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Effect of changing the composition of the bathing solutions upon the isometric tension-pCa relationship in bundles of crustacean myofibrils.", "abstract": "1. The relative isometric tension-pCa relationship has been determined for isolated bundles of barnacle myofibrils under a variety of ionic conditions using [Ca(2+)]-buffered solutions which also contained an ATP regenerating system (creatine phosphate and creatine kinase).2. The results are in better agreement with the ;consecutive' scheme of reaction rather than with the ;independent' alternative (Ashley & Moisescu, 1972) for the co-operative action of two Ca(2+) ions in the process of tension activation in crustacean skeletal muscle.3. Variations in the pH of the activating solutions did have a marked effect on the relative tension-Ca curve, although no effect was observed on the absolute maximum value for isometric tension. A shift in pH by 0.5 u. in the range 6.6-7.6 shifted the Ca(2+)-activation curve by 0.5 log u. towards lower free Ca(2+) concentrations.4. Changes in the free Mg(2+) concentration of the activating solutions in the millimolar range produced a pronounced shift of the relative tension-pCa curve along the pCa axis. Increasing [Mg(2+)] from 1 to 5 mM shifted the curve by about 0.7 log u. to higher free Ca(2+) concentrations, without significantly modifying its steepness.5. Changes in the MgATP concentration of the activating solutions in the range of 1-13 mM had no significant effect on the relative tension-pCa relationship.6. Varying the K(+) concentration in the activating solutions was also observed to have a marked effect upon the tension-pCa relationship in barnacle. An increase in the K(+) concentration from 90 to 170 mM shifted the curve by some 0.6 log u. towards higher free Ca(2+) concentrations.7. Cooling the standard activating solutions from room temperature to +4 degrees C made no apparent difference to the relative tension-pCa relationship, but decreased significantly the absolute tension responses.8. The results presented show that tonicity by itself has a marked effect upon the absolute steady-state tension levels in isolated bundles of myofibrils.9. Maximum isometric tension in this preparation was not simply related to ionic strength, or to the monovalent cation concentration, but it depended, as well, upon the anionic composition of the activating solution. In addition, a change in ionic strength of 25 mM over the range of 245-270 mM did not appear to modify the relative tension-pCa relationship.10. The effect of the physiologically occurring cations H(+), K(+), Mg(2+) upon the relative isometric tension-pCa relationship can be accounted for on the basis of a model of competitive inhibition between these cations and Ca(2+) for the functional unit for tension. This inhibitory effect appears to involve at least one H(+), one Mg(2+) and two K(+) per each Ca(2+) ion participating in the activation process of the functional unit for tension.", "pmid": "20499", "mesh_set": "D000255 D000818 D002118 D006863 D066298 D008274 D009119 D009210 D011188 D013696 D001468", "score": 23.907858, "rank": 1207, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Although the serum levels of both enzymes injected were almost indentical during the first 6 h, the liver uptake of 131I-labeled hen lysozyme was 2.2-fold more than that of 131I-labeled rat lysozyme at the peak time of 5 min after injection.

This compound has been tested for mutagenicity on Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535. It is concluded that 1,2-dichloroethane gives a weak direct mutagenic effect, which is enhanced by addition of the postmitochondrial liver fraction (S-9). This activation is NADPH-independent and non microsomal. It is caused by a factor in the soluble fraction (115 000 g supernatant). This activation was further enhanced by the addition of glutathione but not by the addition of L-cysteine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine or 2-mercaptoethanol. No activation was observed when glutathione was added in the presence of a totally denaturated S-9 fraction or in the absence of this fraction. Activation of 1,2-dichloroethane was also found in the presence of glutathione and glutathione S-transferase A and C but not with glutathione S-tranferase B. A synthetic conjugate S-(2-chloroethyl)-L-cysteine gave a strong direct mutagenic effect at concentrations where no effects were seen with 1,2-dichloroethane. It is thus concluded that 1,2-dichloroethane is activated by conjugation to glutathione.

Reserpine treatment produced a slow decrease in self-stimulation (SS) rates during the first 12 h; SS rates were 85% of control values 24 h after reserpine treatment. Injection of alpha-MPT in reserpine-pretreated rats inhibited SS (85% decrease 3 h after administration either in AVT or LH rats), whereas dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibition had no great effect on SS. The administration of very low doses of alpha-MPT (20 mg/kg i.p.) to rats treated with reserpine (24 h before) plus FLA-63 (1 h before) induced an important decrease in SS rates in AVT-implanted rats only.

The level of norepinephrine increased in the cultured ganglia to a maximum of 225% of that seen in control ganglia. The increases in both dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity and in norepinephrine levels required protein synthesis but they were not dependent on the presence of nerve growth factor. The accumulation of norepinephrine in the cultured ganglia could not be explained by an increased rate of amine synthesis. Turnover measurements suggest that the accumulation can be explained by a decreased rate of amine metabolism in the cultured ganglia. A comparison of the distribution of amine storage vesicles showed that the number of heavy vesicles was greater in cultured than in fresh ganglia.

The correlation of effects of pH and deuteration on the spectra of model compounds with these effects on the Neoprotosil spectrum allows us to assign spectral bands in the 900-1000 and 100-1200 cm-1 regions to the SO2NH2 group. Large shifts in these bands occur upon ionization of the sulfonamide. On the basis of the positions of bands in the enzyme complex, it was determined that the sulfonamide was bound to the enzyme as SO2NH2, rather than as SO2NH-. Rates of association and dissociation and the dissociation equilibrium constant were measured as a function of pH. The rate behavior for Neoprontosil is consistent with that observed for other sulfonamides and kdissoc/kassoc = kdissoc, suggesting a one-step binding mechanism. Since RR spectroscopy establishes that the final ionization state of the sulfonamide in the enzyme complex is SO2NH2, protonated sulfonamide must bind directly to basic form of the enzyme.

Exposure of slices of cerebral cortex from guinea pigs to electrical pulses for 10s or to noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine or histamine increases the rate of phosphorylation of unidentified proteins in the tissue; the increases in protein phosphorylation due to electrical pulses and noradrenaline were non-additive, whereas the increases due to pulses and 5-hydroxytryptamine or histamine were additive. 2.

The increase in protein phosphorylation associated with electrical pulses was antagonized by 10 mum-trifluoperazine and 0.5 mum-prostaglandin E1. 4.

Cranial to a lesion of the spinal cord, the alpha-methyltyrosine-induced disappearance of noradrenaline was accelerated by the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agents yohimbine (10 mg/kg), piperoxan (60 mg/kg) and tolazoline (50 mg/kg). In the absence of nerve impulses caudal to a lesion of the spinal cord, this disappearance was decelerated as compared to that cranial to the lesion and it was not influenced by the three alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. 2. The nialamide-induced accumulation of normetanephrine in the whole brain was increased by phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg) and yohimbine whereas it was decreased by the alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulating agent clonidine (0.1 mg/kg). The effect of clonidine was completely antagonized by yohimbine, but not by phenoxybenzamine, giving further evidence for the view that clonidine and yohimbine have a stronger effect than phenoxybenzamine on the alpha-adrenoreceptors regulating the release of noradrenaline induced by nerve impluses. 3. The accumulation of Dopa after decarboxylase inhibition cranial to a lesion of the spinal cord was accelerated by yohimbine, piperoxan and tolazoline, but not significantly affected by phenoxybenzamine and haloperidol (10 mg/kg). In the absence of nerve impulses caudal to a lesion of the spinal cord, the popa accumulation was decelerated as compared to that cranial to the lesion and it was not influenced by the former three alpha--adrenoreceptor blocking agents as well as by clonidine. 4. The results show that the synthesis and the utilization noradrenaline normally, as well as the accelerations of these processes by alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agents, are dependent on nerve impulses. The stimulation of the synthesis and utilization of noradrenaline by nerve impulses might by influenced via the activity of teh alpha-adrenoreceptors located either on the nerve terminals or on the cell bodies or on both parts of the noradrenergic neurones.

The majority (approximately 95%) of this activity was found in the cytoplasmic extract but appeared not to be associated with the lysosomal fraction. m7G(5')pppG was hydrolyzed by the partially purified enzyme in the absence of divalent cations at a pH optimum of 7.5 and a temperature optimum of 45 degrees, with a Michaelis constant (Km) of 1.7 micronM. Sedimentation analysis and gel filtration showed the molecular weight of the enzyme as approximately 81,000. Inhibition studies testing the effect of a number of prospective substrates on the rate of m7G(5')pppG hydrolysis have confirmed the importance of the methyl moiety at the N7 position of guanosine for enzyme-substrate interaction.

During growth the extracellular pH decreased from 7.1 to 5.1; simultaneously the intracellular pH changed from 7.5 to 5.9. Thus, the intracellular pH was more alkaline than the extracellular pH by 0.4 to 0.8 pH-units. 2. This pH gradient (interior alkaline) was abolished by the proton conductor carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The pH gradient could not be demonstrated in cells depleted of an energy substrate. These results suggest that the pH gradient is formed by an ATPase-driven extrusion of protons from the cells rather than by a Donnan potential. 3. Growth of the organism was inhibited by low concentrations of both carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (5 muM) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (5 muM).

In contrast, these impairments were not found in the non-cerebellar parts of the brain and liver of jj Gunn rat.

The enzyme activity was not affected in the non-cerebellar parts of the brain. Although bilirubin competitively inhibited cerebellar thymidine kinase activity in vitro (15% at 10(-5) M), such bilirubin level was found to be about 1000-fold that in vivo. Moreover, photo-degradation of bilirubin in jj cerebellum exhibited no improvement in thymidine kinase activity, and the presence of an enzyme inactivator was not suggested in jj cerebellum.

The greater recovery of guanylate cyclase activity was found to be due to a release of an endogenous activating factor for guanylate cyclase.

The molecular weight was estimated to be between 300 and 600 by a Sephadex G-15 column and Diaflo ultrafilter membranes. It was stable in dilute acids, but labile in alkaline solution. It was readily soluble in water, but insoluble in organic solvents. Treatment with various enzymes, so far as tested, failed to abolish the activity. The activating factor stimulated the initial velocity of the reaction. It altered neither the Km value for GTP nor the dependency of the enzyme on divalent metals.

The factor V activity of frozen-and-thawed platelet suspensions was markedly diminished after exposure to a factor V antibody, was not activated by thrombin, and was not associated with an increase in factor V antigen over that found in fresh platelet suspensions. Consequently, disruption by freezing and thawing must have resulted in the appearance of small amounts of an activated factor V molecule in platelet suspensions. Disrupted platelets were shown to activate native factor V, but an interaction between a platelet activator and traces of native factor V in fresh suspensions could not be demonstrated to account for the full activity of frozen-and-thawed suspensions.

{"title": "Alprenolol fails to antagonize the metabolic changes following repeated thyroxine injections in the rat.", "abstract": "Repeated injections of rat with 1-thyroxine (50 microgram/kg daily for 5 five-day weeks) retarded the weight gain of the animals and increased the absolute and relative size of the heart, adrenals and interscapular brown adipose tissue. In the myocardium and thigh muscle, thyroxine treatment resulted in elevated activity of oxidative enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, while the activities of glycolytic enzymes remained unchanged. Glycogen content of the heart was decreased following thyroxine regime. In the brown fat, on the other hand, thyroxine injections resulted in a reduction of the activity of oxidative enzymes. This reduction can be accounted for by the decreased protein (enzyme) content of the tissue due to deposition of fat. Furthermore, thyroxine treatment delayed the body cooling of the rats swimming in water at 25 degrees C and enhanced hyperthermic response to injected noradrenaline. All these changes, which were not observable in rats treated with daily alprenolol (20 mg/kg) injections, were as pronounced in rats injected with alprenolol together with thyroxine as in rats injected with thyroxine only.

Here, we characterized the Streptomyces spp. for their colonization ability, plant growth promotion and protection against fungal disease in three cereals. In vitro analysis by dual culture study showed inhibitory effect on the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae B157 along with inhibition of the ubiquitous phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani by the Streptomyces spp. used in this study. The active compounds responsible for phytopathogen inhibition were extracted with ethyl acetate and tested positive against the fungal pathogens. GC-MS based identification of the active compounds responsible for fungal pathogen inhibition showed them to be 2-(chloromethyl)-2-cyclopropyloxirane, 2, 4- ditert-butylphenol and 1-ethylthio-3-methyl-1, 3-butadiene in extracts of culture supernatants from the three different strains respectively. EGFP tagged Streptomyces strains showed profuse colonization in roots as well as aerial parts of cereal plants. Direct inhibitory action against M. oryzae B157 and R. solani correlated with the observation that upon fungal pathogen challenge, the bacterized rice, sorghum and wheat plants showed significantly good plant growth, particularly in aerial parts as compared to unbacterized controls. In addition, benefit was seen in inoculated healthy plants in terms of increase in wet weight of roots and shoots as compared to the uninoculated controls.

These adducts, which are presumed to be hemithioacetals, equilibrate rapidly with the unhydrated form of the aldehyde, which is the subtrate for D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The adduct provides a substrate buffer system whereby a constant low free aldehyde concentration can be maintained during the oxidation of aldehyde by the enzyme and NAD+. With this system, the kinetics of the association of the aldehyde with the enzyme were examined. The rate profile for this reaction is a single exponential process, showing that all four active sites of the enzyme have equivalent and independent reactivity towards the aldehyde, with an apparent second-order rate constant of 5 X 10(7)M-1-S-1 at pH8.0 and 21 degrees C. The second-order rate constant becomes 8 X 10(7)M-1-S-1 when account is taken of the forward and reverse catalytic rate constants of the dehydrogenase. The pH-dependence of the observed rate constant is consistent with a requirement for the unprotonated form of a group of pK 6.1, which is the pK observed for second ionization of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The rate of phosphorolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate during the steady-state oxidative phosphorylation of the aldehyde was studied, and is proportional to the total Pi concentration up to at least 1 mM-Pi at pH 7.5. The pH-dependence of the rate of NADH generation under these conditions can be explained by the rate law d[NADA]/dt = k[acy] holoenzyme][PO4(3-)-A1, where thioester bond, although kinetically indistinguishable rate equations for the reaction are possible. The rates of the phosphorolysis reaction and of the aldehyde-association reaction decrease with increasing ionic strength, suggesting that the active site of the enzyme has cationic groups which are involved in the reaction of the enzyme with anionic substrates.", "pmid": "12740", "mesh_set": "D055598 D002621 D004229 D005985 D005987 D006863 D007700 D009994 D010710", "score": 16.980589, "rank": 3578, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Endothelial injury was achieved by infusing air briefly into a segment of right common carotid artery. Beginning before or after surgery, experimental animals were given sufficient drug to suppress platelet aggregation in vitro in response to collagen, adenosine diphosphate, or thrombin. The carotid arteries were fixed by perfusion at 5 and 14 days after injury and examined by light, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy for platelet activity and intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation in the denuded segment. Platelets in platelet-rich plasma from control animals aggregated in response to collagen, adenosine diphosphate, and thrombin; platelets from aspirin-, flurbiprofen- and reserpine-treated rats showed markedly diminished aggregation in response to collagen and normal or slightly diminished aggregation in response to ADP and thrombin. At 5 days, platelets from control animals formed a dense layer in the denuded segment: at 14 days, marked intimal thickening due to smooth muscle cell hyperplasia was observed. In experimental animals, the platelets were morphologically identical with controls and covered the denuded segment; serotonin granules were missing in platelets of reserpine-treated rats.

Groups of control rats were injected sc with normal horse serum (NHS) at these same stages, and in all rats, the progesterone level in jugular blood serum was measured by RIA on the day of treatment and 24 and 72 h after treatment. Among the PRG rats, the controls' progesterone levels rose to a peak on day 15, and then slowly declined. LH-AS on day 9 induced abortion and a rapid, drastic and permanent fall in the progesterone level in all rats. On day 12, it induced a similar fall in progesterone, and abortion, in 4 of 10 rats; in the 6 which remained pregnant, a much less severe fall occurred 24 h after treatment, and by 72 h the level had returned to close to the initial one. On days 15 or 18, LH-AS induced neither abortion nor a significant change in the progesterone level from that seen in the controls. Among the PSP rats, the controls' progesterone levels tended to fall progressively after day 9; the average length of diestrus was about 21 days. At each of the four stages the LH-AS induced a rapid, drastic and permanent fall in the progesterone level. Early termination of the diestrus was easily discernible in the groups injected on days 9 or 12, but was obscured in the other groups because of the similarity in length of the expected remaining diestrus and the duration of the neutralizing effect of the LH-AS on LH in the circulation. The PSP rats' CL, thus, once they become dependent on LH (about day 9), remain so to the end of PSP.

Calorimetry shows that apo A-1 (5 to 40 mg/ml, pH 9.2) undergoes a two-state, reversible denaturation (enthalpy = 64 +/- 8.9 kcal/mole), between 43--71 degrees (midpoint temperature, Tm = 54 degrees), associated with a rise in heat capacity (deltaCvd) of 2.4 +/- 0.5 kcal/mole/degrees C. Apo A-1 (0.2 to 0.4 mg/ml, pH 9.2) develops a negative difference spectrum between 42--70 degrees, with Tm = 53 degrees. The enthalpy (deltaH = 59 +/- 5.7 kcal/mole at Tm) and heat capacity change (2.7 +/- 0.9 kcal/mole/degrees C) in the spectroscopic experiments were not significantly different from the calorimetric values. Below pH 9 and above pH 11, the calorimetric Tm and deltaH of denaturation are decreased. In the pH range of reversible denaturation (6.5 to 11.8), delatH and Tm are linearly related, showing that the heat capacity change (ddeltaH/dT) associated with denaturation is independent of Tm. In urea solutions, the calorimetric Tm and deltaH of denaturation are decreased. At 25 degrees, apo A-1 develops a negative difference spectrum between 1.4 and 3 M urea. Fifty per cent of the spectral change occurs in 2.4 M urea, which corresponds to the urea concentration obtained by extrapolation of the calorimetric Tm to 25 degrees. In urea solution of less than 0.75 M there is hyperchromicity at 285 nm (delta epsilon = 264 in 0.75 M urea), indicating strong interaction of aromatic amino acid residues in the native molecule with the solvent. Spectrophotometric titration of apo A-1 shows that 6.6 of the 7 tyrosine groups of apo A-1 titrate at pH less than 11.9, with similar titration curves obtained in aqueous solutions and in 6 M urea. The free energy of stabilization (deltaG) of the native conformation of apo A-1 was estimated, (a) at 37 degrees, using the calorimetric deltaA and deltaCvd, and (b) at 25 degrees, by extrapolation of spectroscopic data to zero urea concentration. The values (deltaG (37 degrees) = 2.4 and deltaG (25 degrees) = 2.7 kcal/mole) are small compared to typical globular proteins, indicating that native apo A-1 has a loosely folded tertiary structure. The low values of deltaG reflect the high degree of exposure of hydrophobic areas in the native protein molecule. The loosely folded conformation of apo A-1 allows extensive binding of lipid, since this can involve both surface hydrophobic sites and hydrophobic areas exposed by a cooperative, low energy unfolding process.", "pmid": "6462", "mesh_set": "D001059 D001665 D002151 D006801 D006863 D007700 D008075 D008433 D011485 D011487 D012260 D013056 D013696 D013816 D014508", "score": 10.425798, "rank": 6017, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The antioxidant assay was performed to evaluate the scavenging rate. The effects of Ch/AgNPs on burn wound healing was also evaluated by histopathological, molecular, and biochemical evaluations after 7, 14 and 28 days of treatment in a rat model. In comparison to the negative control and silver sulfadiazine groups, the Ch/AgNPs treated wounds exhibited significantly lower inflammatory reaction as determined by the reduced level of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and neutrophil counts. Treatment by Ch/AgNPs also significantly enhanced re-epithelialization, so that complete epithelialization was achieved in the lesions of the animals of this group, at the 7th day post-wounding. Rapid re-epithelialization, improved granulation tissue formation, reduced IL-1\u03b2 expression, mild inflammation, and increased transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and basic fibroblast growth factor, at 7 days post-wounding, are convincing reasons to confirm this idea that Ch/AgNPs are effective in speeding up the wound healing stages. Our histopathological findings are in agreement with the molecular and biochemical results and strongly demonstrate that Ch/AgNPs stimulate burn wound healing by decreasing the length of repair phases.

Eight percent of the VLG cells had ambient receptive fields. These cells were characterized by an unusually regular maintained discharge which varied in rate in relation to the level of receptive-field illumination or of full-field ambient illumination. About 4% of the VLG cells were movement sensitive. They gave little or no response to stationary stimuli flashed on or off in the receptive field, and responded best to a contour moving across the receptive field in any direction. An additional 2.5% of the VLG cells were direction sensitive. Their response was dependent on the direction of stimulus movement through the receptive field. Sixteen percent of the VLG cells had indefinite receptive fields. They responded to whole-eye illumination or to localized visual-field stimulation; however, specific receptive-field properties could not be adequately defined. Approximately 23% of the VLG cells studied gave no convincing response to visual stimulation. 3. Responses of DLG cells agreed with those reported in previous studies. Almost all (97%) had concentric receptive fields, and a few (3%) had uniform receptive fields with no apparent antagonistic surround. None of the DLG cells had receptive fields like those in the other classes found for VLG cells. 4. The VLG cells tended to have large receptive fields; mean diameter was 10.6 degrees of visual arc. This was substantially larger than the diameter of receptive fields for DLG cells. In addition, VLG cells generally required larger stimuli than DLG cells to respond. There was no consistent relationship between receptive-field size and visual-field eccentricity for VLG cells, in contrast to the DLG. Most (57%) VLG cells were driven only by the contralateral eye, 30% were binocularly driven, and 13% were driven only by the ipsilateral eye. 5. A systematic visuotopic organization was present in the VLG. The lower visual field was represented anteriorly in the nucleus and the upper visual field posteriorly. The vertical meridian was represented along the dorsomedial border of the VLG where it abuts the DLG, and the temporal periphery was represented ventrolaterally. 6. Responses to electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm were studied for 55 VLG cells...", "pmid": "845627", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000818 D002415 D004292 D004558 D005260 D005829 D008297 D009038 D009897 D010775 D012160 D013045 D014794 D014795", "score": 13.187125, "rank": 5388, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "The role of dopaminergic systems in gamma-hydroxybutyrate-induced electrocorticogram hypersynchronization in the rat.", "abstract": "The effects of dopaminergic agonists and antagonists on the duration of hypersynchronization induced in the electrocorticogram (ecog) by gamma-hydroxybutyrate (gamma-HB) were tested in rats. Apomorphine (0-2-8 mg kg-1), piribedil (2-5-10 mg kt-1) and haloperidol (0-5-1 mg kg-1) had no influence on the duration of the hypersynchrony. Amphetamine (1-5-6 mg kg-1) inhibited the hypersynchrony, while (3,4-dihydroxyphenylamino)-2-imidazoline (DPI; 5, but not 1, mg kg-1) prolonged its duration. The lack of effect of the dopamine receptor agonists apomorphine and piribedil, and the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol, on the gamma-HB-induced hypersynchrony might indicate that the inhibition of the impulse flow in the nigrostriatal dopamine system by gamma-HB is not involved in the generation of the hypersynchrony. DPI is thought to be an agonist at a dopamine receptor not sensitive to apomorphine, and its facilitatory effect on gamam-HB-hypersynchrony can be interpreted in terms of a possible involvement of another dopamine system in the ecog hypersynchrony induced by gamma-HB. The antagonism of gamma-HB by amphetamine is possibly due to an indirect stimulatory effect on noradrenergic receptors.", "pmid": "21239", "mesh_set": "D000661 D000818 D001522 D003344 D003891 D004298 D004569 D006220 D006885 D008297 D010891 D051381 D011954", "score": 29.880726, "rank": 501, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Phototherapy in Gunn rats. A study to assess the photobiologically most effective radiant energy and dose/response relationships.", "abstract": "In order to get a more realistic spectral efficiency curve and to evaluate dose/response relationships in phototherapy, homozygous weanling Gunn rats -- nondepilated, with fur -- were illuminated under standardized conditions with 8 different fluorescent tubes. Some of the tubes were operated with different electric power. Clear spectal differences in the extent and the rapidity of the bilirubin decay could be ascertained. Furthermore, the sharpness of the bilirubin decrease depended on the baseline concentration. For the calculations the animals were therefore divided into 3 groups with starting levels of larger than or equal to 8 mg%, 6.5--7.9 mg% and less than 6.5 mg%. Correlating the spectral power distribution of the lamps with the bilirubin decomposition found in the experiment, the spectral response function s(lambda)bili, rel was calculated by an integral method. A comparison of our results with data from the literature shows that so far near UV radiation was evaluated too high. A new radiometer for digital measuring the effective irradiance Ebili was developed. On a logarithmic scale a comparatively sharp dose/response relationship could be demonstrated in dependence on the measured effective radiant exposure. Serum bilirubin decrease is directly proportional to log Ebili. A dose of about 2.5 mW - h/cm2 is necessary to achieve a constant serum bilirubin decrease at all. Good results were obtained at doses of about 35 mW - h/cm2 with the most efficient being at 160 mW - h/cm2. Highly effective doses can be applied with different types of lamps. However, there are great differences in the time of illumination required. 24 h are necessary with daylight tubes (Osram L 20 W/19) to apply 20 mW - h/cm2, whereas the same dose is already attained after 4 h with BAM blue tubes (Philips). The accuracy of the radiometer was finally controlled by screening Westinghouse special blue and Osram standard blue tubes with black tapes, so that the effective irradiance (Ebili) corresponded to that of Osram daylight tubes. The bilirubin decrease observed after this manipulation was nearly identical (not exceeding 1 SD of the daylight values). Since bilirubin decrease was sharper in the first few hours of illumination, continuous phototherapy was compared in some tests with 3 intermittent schedules: (a) 4 h light, 4 h dark, 4 h light; (b) 5 h light, 2 h dark, 5 h light, (c) alternately 2 h light and 2 h dark. There was no indication that more bilirubin could be removed per hour with intermittent phototherapy than with continuous illumination.", "pmid": "861321", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001663 D004307 D005453 D008027 D011874 D051381 D013056 D013223 D013997", "score": 19.757538, "rank": 2344, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Proton translocation and the respiratory nitrate reductase of Escherichia coli.", "abstract": "Stoicheometries and rates of proton translocation associated with respiratory reduction of NO3- have been measured for spheroplasts of Escherichia coli grown anaerobically in the presence of NO3-. Observed stoicheiometries [leads to H+/NO3- ratio; P. Mitchell (1966) Chemiosmotic Coupling in Oxidative and Photosynthetic Phosphorylation, Glynn Research, Bodmin] were approx. 4 for L-malate oxidation and approx. 2 for succinate, D-lactate and glycerol oxidation. Measurements of the leads to H+/2e- ratio with formate as the reductant and oxygen or NO3- as the oxidant were complicated by pH changes associated with formate uptake and CO2 formation. Nevertheless, it was possible to conclude that the site of formate oxidation is on the inner aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane, that the leads to H+/O ratio for formate oxidation is approx. 4, and that the leads to H+/NO3- ratio is greater than 2. Measurements of the rate of NO3- penetration into osmotically sensitive spheroplasts demonstrated an electrogenic entry of NO3- anion. The permeability coefficient for nitrate entry at 30 degrees C was between 10(-9) and 10(-10) cm- s(-1). The calculated rate of nitrate entry at the concentration typically used for the assay of nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4) activity was about 0.1% of that required to support the observed rate of nitrate reduction by reduced Benzyl Viologen. Measurements of the distribution of nitrate between the intracellular and extracellular spaces of a haem-less mutant, de-repressed for nitrate reductase but unable to reduce nitrate by the respiratory chain, showed that, irrespective of the presence or the absence of added glucose, nitrate was not concentrated intracellularly. Osmotic-swelling experiments showed that the rate of diffusion of azid anion across the cytoplasmic membrane is relatively low in comparison with the fast diffusion of hydrazoic acid. The inhibitory effect of azide on nitrate reductase was not altered by treatments that modify pH gradients across the cytoplasmic membrane. It is concluded that the nitrate-reducing azide-sensitive site of nitrate reductase is located on the outer aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane. The consequences of this location for mechanisms of proton translocation driven by nitrate reduction are discussed, and lead to the proposal that the nitrate reductase of the cytoplasmic membrane is vectorial, reducing nitrate on the outer aspect of the membrane with 2H+ and 2e- that have crossed from the inner aspect of the membrane.", "pmid": "5996", "mesh_set": "D000693 D001386 D003580 D004926 D005561 D006863 D009565 D009566 D009573 D009995 D010084 D010101 D011522 D013104", "score": 8.125821, "rank": 6119, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The histamine effect was dose-dependent with the most effective time of administration being from the 5th to the 10th day after adjuvant injection. Arthritic lesions found in control animals in histological and roentgenographic examinations were also inhibited in histamine-treated animals.

This consisted of 3 weeks on the previously used hypnotic, 3 weeks on a test drug (during the first of these a doubling of the dose was permitted if the initial dose of 1 mg flunitrazepam, 5 mg nitrazepam or one tablet of placebo was not satisfactory) and 4 weeks' observation after a request to stop medication with the test drug.

Also noted were: the frequency of dose increase after 1 week of the test period, number of drop-outs in the test period, and failure in the attempt to stop taking the test drug. A \"psychological concentration test\" was done, as was a follow-up interview. The self-ratings had a good reliability and showed that more patients experienced shorter sleep induction, longer sleep time, better sleep quality and a subjective feeling of having had a better rest with flunitrazepam than with either nitrazepam or placebo. There were no differences between the nitrazepam and the placebo groups. Tiredness was the most common side effect and appeared in the same frequency in all groups. The number of patients who increased the dose after 1 week's medication, as well as the number of drop-outs, was significantly higher in the nitrazepam and placebo groups than in the flunitrazepam group. There was no difference in the ability to discontinue the medication between the test groups or between groups having previously used different hypnotics. The \"psychological concentration test\" did not reveal any differences between groups. It was concluded that withdrawal of a hypnotic in chronic users was not facilitated by the use of a placebo.

{"title": "Inhibition of dopamine synthesis in chronic schizophrenia.

As a clinical test of this hypothesis, we administered metyrosine for three weeks to symptomatic chronic male schizophrenic patients who were maintained on suboptimal doses of neuroleptic agents. Metyrosine inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzymatic step in the synthesis of DA. No clinical improvement was observed, using the National Institute of Mental Health Inpatient Behavioral Rating Scale or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Central inhibition of DA synthesis by metyrosine was suggested, however, by (1) the development of extrapyramidal side effects and (2) a significant increase in plasma prolactin concentrations. Plasma chlorpromazine concentrations remained unchanged during metyrosine treatment. There was, nevertheless, a significant improvement on the scores of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Comprehension subtest, which measures judgment and common sense.

{"title": "Association of gylcogenolysis with cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.", "abstract": "Sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments isolated from dog cardiac muscle possess a calcium-accumulating system associated with a series of enzymes linked to glycogenolysis. These enzymes include: adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylase b kinase, phosphorylase (b/a, 30/1),\"debrancher\" enzyme, and glycogen (0.3 to 0.7 mg/mg of protein). The sarcoplasmic reticulum preparation produced glucose 1-phosphate and glucose from either endogenous or exogenous glycogen. Both the calcium-accumulating and glycogenolytic enzymes sediment in a single peak at 33% sucrose on a linear continous sucrose density gradient, and the complex remains intact throughout repeated washing. Glycogen particles appear to be associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum in situ as well as in the isolated microsomal fraction. The sarcoplasmic reticulum-glycogenolytic complex, monitored by a linked enzyme spectrophotometric assay, shows several features: (a) activation of phosphorylase activity to peak rate occurs over a very rapid time course which cannot be duplicated using combinations of purified enzymes; (b) activation is inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor; (c) phosphorylase b functions as in the purified form with respect to AMP (Km, 0.3 mM); (d) in the presence of limiting amounts of glycogen, optimal phosphorylase b activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum requires the presence of debrancher, and the activity is sensitive to inhibitors of that enzyme such as Tris, which suggests the possiblity that the enzymes bear a specific structual relationship to the glycogen present. Phosphorylase b leads to a activation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was completely resistant to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl either)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Inhibition of calcium accumulation by or release of bound calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum by X537A (RO 2-2985) did not alter the EGTA resistance.

End-plate currents have been studied in frog cutaneus pectoris nerve-muscle preparations mounted in continuously flowing solution, using the voltage clamp technique. 2. Exposure of the muscle to 1 mM-dithiothreitol reduced the amplitude of end-plate currents by a factor of 2.7 (mean; range 1.6-3.4; twelve fibres). 3. 1 mM-dithiothreitol also caused a 2.7-fold (2.3-3.1) increase in the rate of decay, and a 1.4-fold (1.3-1.6) decrease in the time to peak of end-plate currents. During the onset of action of dithiothreitol, there was little or no indication of departure of end-plate current decay from a simple exponential. 4. Dithiothreitol actions on amplitude and decay of end-plate currents developed with similar time courses and both effects were slower in onset at pH 7.2 than at pH 8.5. 5. The actions of dithiothreitol were reversed by exposure of the muscle to 1 mM-5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). 6. Following dithiothreitol treatment, the rates of decay of end-plate currents continued to depend on membrane potential; there was little or no change in the slope of the relation between in (rate of decay) and membrane potential, consistent with little or no change in the dipole moment of a gating molecule for ion channels. 7. Dithiothreitol changed the relation between peak end-plate current and membrane potential, so that peak conductance increased at more negative membrane potentials; this finding could be accounted for in terms of the closure of ion-channel gates becoming faster though remaining voltage-sensitive after exposure to dithiothreitol. 8. It is concluded that dithiothreitol causes changes in the kinetics of gating of ion channels associated with receptors and that these changes accompany changes in the binding of ACh to receptors.", "pmid": "25960", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001001 D004229 D006863 D066298 D008564 D009045 D009469 D011896", "score": 19.639915, "rank": 2383, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Effects of acetylsalicylate on alkalinization, acid secretion and electrogenic properties in the isolated gastric mucosa.", "abstract": "The effects of acetylsalicylate (ASA) on the in vitro secretory and electrical properties of Necturus and Rana temporaria gastric mucosa have been studied. The gastric antrum alkalinized the luminal surface, while in the fundus it is likely that acidificaiton and alkalinization occur simultaneously and that net secretion is due to the dominance of one or other of these processes. The histamine H2  receptor antagonist Metiamide was used to inhibit acid secretion for studies on fundic alkalinization in Rana temporaria. Submucosal application of 3 mM ASA for 30 min markedly reduced alkalinization in the antrum and the frog fundus. Following removal of ASA there was only partial recovery of this secretion. The drug caused slight inhibtion of spontaneous acid secretion in Necturus fundus but not of histamine-stimulated acid secretion in the frog fundus. Following salicylate removal, the rate of acid secretion increased to a higher level than before administration in both tissues. There was a small flux of ASA across the mucosa which was greatest in the acid secreting frog fundus (4.38mumol cm-2 min-1) and least in the antrum (2.19 mumol cm-2 min-1). Esposure of the gastric mucosa to ASA was generally associated with a fall in transmucosal electric potential difference and short-circuit current together with an increase in electrical resistance. It is proposed that the greater sensitivity of alkalinization to ASA is responsible for the apparent increase in the rate of acid secretion which occured.", "pmid": "15402", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001001 D001241 D005071 D005745 D005750 D005753 D006863 D008785 D011896 D012636 D014562", "score": 22.91529, "rank": 1404, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Regulation of heme pathway enzymes and cellular glutathione content by metals that do not chelate with tetrapyrroles: blockade of metal effects by thiols.", "abstract": "The trace metals nickel and platinum, which are not substrates for ferrochelatase and thus do not form heme in biological systems, were found to act similaryl to cobalt, and heme itself, in regulating heme metabolism in liver and kidney. These metals induced heme oxygenase activity in both organs with the peak of induced enzyme activity reached approximately 16 hr after single injections in rats. Both metals caused transient depression of cellular glutathione content followed by increases above normal after 12 hr in liver. Nickel and platinum were more potent inducers of heme oxygenase in kidney than in liver (10-13 times normal versus 5-6 times normal). At high concentrations, they inhibited heme oxygenase [heme, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (alpha-methene-oxidizing, hydroxylating), EC 1.14.99.3] in vitro. Both were active in regulating heme metabolism only when administered in the ionic form. Complexing of the metals with sulfhydryl agents completely blocked their actions on heme metabolism. Administration of cysteine orally prior to or shortly after administration of the metals had a similar blocking effect. Nickel and platinum produced depression of delta-aminolevulinate synthase [succinyl-CoA:glycine c-succinyltransferase (decarboxylating), EC 2.3.1.37] activity in liver, but neigther inhibited this rate-limiting ennzyme for heme synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, despite the substantial decreases in cellular heme and hemoprotein contents mediated by the metal, production of delta-amimolevulinate synthase did not undergo the compensatory increase that would be expected if there were a direct reciprocal feedback relationship between cellular heme level and synthesis of this enzyme. These findings indicate that it is not necessary for metal ions to be chelated in the porphyrin ring in order to regulate the enzymes of heme synthesis and heme oxidation. Accordingly, it is suggested that the iron atom of heme is the proximately active regulator of delta-aminolevulinate synthase and heme oxygenase--actions generally ascribed to the iron-tetrapyrrole complex itself--and that the tetrapyrrole moiety of the complex functions primarily as a means of transport of the metal to regulatory sites in cells.", "pmid": "266710", "mesh_set": "D000624 D000818 D001665 D003035 D003545 D003577 D004790 D005978 D006418 D007668 D008099 D008297 D008861 D008862 D006899 D009532 D010984 D051381 D014131", "score": 21.418358, "rank": 1782, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "The effects of anesthetic drugs and disease on the chemical regulation of ventilation.", "abstract": "The anesthesiologist uses a wide spectrum of drugs, including inhalational general anesthetics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, narcotics analgesics and their antagonists, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. All of these drugs in sufficient dose impair the ventilatory response to chemical stimuli, and may cause inadequate gas exchange. The effect of depression of ventilatory control depends on the magnitude of depression and the coexistence of functional abnormalities in the respiratory system. The functional abnormalities are the result of preexistent pulmonary disease or other disease processes that impair respiratory function, the anticipated effects of major surgery (e.g., pulmonary resection), and the complications of anesthesia and surgery. From a functional viewpoint, the mechanisms of the effects of these disease processes on ventilatory control are: (1) interference with the neurophysiological control of automatic ventilation; (2) impairment of peripheral or central chemoreceptor function; (3) impairment of respiratory muscle function; (4) increase in the mechanical load to breathing as a result of increased resistance or decreased compliance of the respiratory system; and (5) increase in the ventilatory requirements as a result of ventilation/blood flow maldistribution, metabolic acidosis, or increased metabolic rate. As a result of current trends in the use of multiple drugs and controlled ventilation during anesthesia, the patient is at greatest risk during the early postoperative period in the recovery room. In addition to the functional abnormalities described above, the probability of impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure is increased as a result of impaired metabolism and elimination of drugs as a result of hepatic and renal insufficiency, and acute changes in acidbase status, which alter the ionization and distribution of drugs.", "pmid": "15949", "mesh_set": "D000777 D014151 D001341 D001463 D001569 D002245 D005283 D006221 D006801 D006980 D000860 D008173 D008614 D008733 D009020 D009270 D009466 D009468 D009765 D011654 D011658 D012119 D012600", "score": 12.411043, "rank": 5650, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The degree of inhibition was linearly related to the logarithm of the bisacodyl concentration over the range of 0.05 to 2.0 mg per 100 ml. In human jejunal segments, bisacodyl, 1 mg per 100 ml, caused net water secretion. Bisacodyl, 5 mg every 6 hr, increased ileostomy output by 15% when it was fed to 5 patients with established ileostomies.

No close coupling is observed between methylation and transcription. During an extensive blocking of methylation, the synthesis of preribosomal 45-S RNA continues, although at a slightly reduced rate. Transcription and methylation can be temporarily uncoupled in vivo without impairing significantly the efficiency of the subsequent maturation of the transcript which takes place when the methylation is resumed. At the post-transcriptional level, two main observations are made. First, the cleavage pattern of ribosomal RNA is not qualitatively modified by the drug treatment. Preribosomal 45-S RNA which is synthesized during an extensive blocking of methylations (95%) is cleaved in vivo in a stepwise fashion into molecules resembling the species of the normal processing. Undermethylation does not result in the appearance of new size products and no extensive or rapid degredation of rRNA precursors can be detected. Second, the global efficiency of the process of ribosomal RNA maturation is severely affected, in quantitative terms; the undermethylation partially inhibits several stages in the maturation pathway and does not block selectively at a definite step of processing, as previously reported by others. Two main modifications are observed. (a) In the nucleus, the life times of the various undermethylated intermediates of ribosomal RNA maturation are markedly increased and a significant accumulation of these forms is detected by long-term labelling studies. (b) The rate of appearance of ribosomal 28-S RNA into the cytoplasm is severely affected (85-90% inhibition), in much higher proportions than the formation of its immediate precursor, nuclear 28-S RNA, thus suggesting a particular sensitivity to a lack of methylation of the last stage of preribosome maturation (possibly the release to cytoplasm).

{"title": "[In vitro inhibition of oxidative N-demethylation with carbon disulfide].", "abstract": "Earlier findings have shown that in experimental animals (rat) and in man inhaled carbon disulphide (CS2) reversibly inhibits the non-specific oxidative drug metabolism caused by hepatic microsomal enzymes. Very little is known concerning the underlying mechanism. The present investigations were undertaken to throw light on this question. After addition of an NADPH-regenerating system to liver microsomes isolated from adult female Wistar rats, the oxidative N-demethylation of aminopyrine was measured under simultaneous exposure to CS2 by quantitatively determining the formaldehyde obtained; the resulting data were evaluated using enzyme-kinetic parameters according to Lineweaver-Burk: 1. Following acute exposure to low and medium-grade CS2 concentrations (20-400 ppm/8 h), the pattern of inhibition in rat liver microsomes is identical to that obtained in normal liver microsomes to which CS2 had been added. This finding seems to suggest that the inhibitory process under in vivo and in vitro conditions is based on one and the same molecular mechanism. 2. Upon addition of CS2 the in vitro pattern of inhibition corresponds to a strong mixed-type inhibition. 3. It is concluded from the enzyme-kinetic behaviour that CS2 attacks at two different sites of the enzyme molecule: Binding to the first site is followed by inhibition, as evidenced by the rise of Km; after saturation of this site, a second site is occupied resulting in a reactivation and, beyond this, an activation of enzyme output, as shown by the decrease of Km. CS2 exhibits a high affinity for the first site, and a low affinity for the second site. Binding at the first site is reversible. The possibility that the active centre in the enzyme molecule is the site where binding of the inhibitor occurs is ruled out. 4. A continuous decrease of Vmax at increasing inhibitor concentration is causally related with the formation of an enzyme/substrate inhibitor complex. 5. The CS2 added to the microsomes can be eliminated by helium gas; this is followed by the return of the original enzyme activity. It is concluded from this behaviour that under in vitro conditions CS2 itself (rather than its metabolites) acts as the inhibitor. 6. Oxygen treatment of the microsome-containing reaction mixture enhances the inhibition. In substrate-free control mixtures, addition of CS2 was followed by the dose-dependent formation of formaldehyde; a causal explanation is not readily available at this time.", "pmid": "7280", "mesh_set": "D000393 D000632 D000818 D001665 D002246 D004305 D005260 D006371 D066298 D007700 D008862 D009249 D010089 D010100 D051381", "score": 20.3915, "rank": 2109, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

If the colour reagents were added together with thiocyanate (final concentration, M/10), the colour intensity was doubled. If sulfanilic acid was added three minutes before addition of naphthylethylenediamine, the relationship between nitrite concentration and colour production was more linear in the presence of thiocyanate. This effect was due to thiocyanate catalysing the diazotization of sulfanilic acid and inhibiting the reaction of nitrite with naphthylethylenediamine. Bromide and thiocyanate are similar in their catalytic effects on nitrosation, and hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid is an effective reagent for denitrosation of nitrosamine. Although thiocyanate catalysed denitrosation of nitrosamines, the effect was small except with nitrosomethylaniline, which had also been found to be denitrosated by sulfanilic acid.

Thermostable membrane vesicles which were capable of active transport of alanine dependent on either respiration or an artificial membrane potential were isolated from the thermophilic aerobic bacterium PS3. 2. Uptake of alanine was dependent on the oxidation of ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate or on generated or exogenous NADH, but succinate and malate failed to drive the uptake. The optimum temperature for respiration-driven uptake of alanine was 45 to 60 degrees. 3. Potassium ion-loaded vesicles were prepared by incubating vesicles at 55 degrees in 0.5 M potassium phosphate. The addition of valinomycin elicited rapid and transient uptake of alanine under the test conditions. Uptake of alanine in response to valinomycin was progressively enhanced by the addition of dicylohexylcarbodiimide, but was completely abolished in the presence of a proton conductor or synthetic permeable cation. The effect of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was dependent on its concentration and was maximal at a concentration of 0.4 mM. 4. The proton permeability of membrane vesicles was reduced by the addition of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. A small but significant difference was found in the initial rates of proton uptake in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide with and without alanine. The results suggest that protons alanine are transported simultaneously in a stoichiometric ratio of 1 : 1. 5. The uptake of alanine was also driven by a pH gradient induced by an instantaneous pH drop in a suspension of alkali-loaded vesicles. Thus, alanine accumulation was driven not only by an electrical potential but also by a pH gradient. 6. Addition of ATP resulted in the inhibition of alanine uptake dependent on artificial membrane potential. ATP hydrolysis by membrane ATPase created a membrane potential which was inside-positive, and this might decrease the effective membrane potential (generated by K+ efflux mediated by valinomycin) available to drive alanine uptake.", "pmid": "8439", "mesh_set": "D000255 D000409 D001419 D001693 D002462 D004024 D006358 D006863 D008274 D009940 D010101 D010539 D011188 D013696 D014634", "score": 20.733078, "rank": 1988, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Since the rise in urine volume was associated with an increase in renal vein prostaglandin E concentration and was prevented by pretreatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg) the results suggest that the rise in plasma angiotensin after renal artery stenosis causes an increase in contralateral prostaglandin E synthesis with resultant antagonism to antidiuretic hormone at the collecting tubule.", "pmid": "845253", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001794 D004285 D005919 D007213 D011141 D011458 D012078 D012083 D012504 D012964 D014294 D014667", "score": 21.320843, "rank": 1815, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The enhanced opiate potency following subcutaneous morphine injection in hypophysectomized rats may be partially explained by adrenal dysfunction, as demonstrated by a similar sensitization to subcutaneous morphine following adrenalectomy. By contrast, no enhancement of opiate potency was observed upon direct intraventricular injection of morphine or beta-endorphin in adrenalectomized rats. Furthermore, the potency of intravenous beta-endorphin is profoundly enhanced in adrenalectomized mice; five out of nine animals died when injected with a dose of the peptide that produced only mild analgesia in sham controls.

The relative saturation of albumin with bilirubin was also measured by addition of salicylate to whole blood samples where bilirubin was also measured by addition of salicylate to whole blood samples where bilirubin dissociated from the albumin could be sequestered by the red cells. The present studies indicate that FFA's influence the binding of bilirubin in two ways. At molar ratios of FFA to albumin (2:1 to 4:1), the FFA's compete with bilirubin for binding at the high-affinity site so that a significant portion of the bilirubin is transported at secondary sites, making it susceptible to displacement by water-soluble organic anions. At high molar ratios (greater than 5:1) FFA's compete with bilirubin for albumin binding at the secondary sites as well. In contrast to crystalline albumin where the first two molar equivalents of FFA do not influence the binding of bilirubin to albumin, all FFA concentrations in hyperbilirubinemic plasma reduce the affinity of albumin for bilirubin at its high-affinity site even though there is a molar excess of albumin over bilirubin.", "pmid": "833468", "mesh_set": "D001663 D001665 D005230 D006801 D007231 D007567 D008954 D011485 D012459 D012709", "score": 13.10404, "rank": 5421, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Purification of rat intestinal maltase/glucoamylase and its anomalous dissociation either by heat or by low pH.", "abstract": "Maltase-glucoamylase, a microvillous membrane ectoenzyme, was solubilized from rat intestinal mucosa by digestion with papain and subsequently purified to homogeneity with an overall yield of 10--20%. An antibody to the purified enzyme formed a single precipitin line in immunodiffusion experiments with an intestinal homogenate. The enzyme was shown to be an acidic glycoprotein (20% sugar by weight) which contained low amounts of cysteine and no sialic acid. At pH3--6, maltase activity was slowly lost, but the enzyme was re-activated by re-adjustment of the pH to neutrality. However, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate, acid pH values inactivated maltase irreversibly, and at the same time converted the enzyme (mol.wt. 500000 approx.) into five new species with apparent molecular weights ranging from 134000 to 480000 as judged by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The same five fragments were also formed by boiling the enzyme for brief periods in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate or urea either with or without reducing agents. The dissociated species were stable on re-electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis showed them to be very similar to each other and to the original enzyme. The bands migrated anomalously on polyacrylamide gels of different concentration, thereby preventing the assignment of precise molecular weights. It is possible that the five species may represent stable aggregates of a common monomer of the enzyme.", "pmid": "29602", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D055598 D002621 D004591 D005087 D005959 D006863 D005779 D007413 D008297 D008970 D051381 D013696 D000520", "score": 15.38363, "rank": 4393, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Milk lipoprotein lipases: a review.", "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase activity has been found in the milks from severals species where it is assumed to result from leakage from the mammary gland into milk. The function of the enzyme in the gland is apparently to assist in the transfer of blood lipoprotein triacylglycerol fatty acids into milk triacylglycerols. Bovine skim milk is one of the richest sources of lipoprotein lipase and this enzyme has been purified extensively (7000 fold) by affinity chromatography. The lipase has a molecular weight of about 62000, is inhibited by protamine sulfate, 1.0 M sodium chloride, apolipoprotein C-I (apolipoprotein-serine), and apolipoprotein C-III (apolipoprotein-alanine). The enzyme is activated by apolipoprotein C-II (apolipoprotein-glutamic acid), serum, and by heparin to which it also binds. The lipase is highly specific for the primary esters of acylglycerols and exhibits a slight stereospecificity for the sn-1 ester in preference to the sn-3-ester. Bovine milk also has separate activity toward 1-monoacylglycerols. Human milk contains a serum stimulated lipoprotein lipase with many of the characteristics of the enzyme in bovine milk, as well as an enzyme stimulated by bile salts which resembles the sterol ester hydrolase of rat pancreatic juice.

The total activity in ascites nuclei was similar but the ratios of polymerase activities were different: polymerase I, 53%; polymerase II, 41%; and polymerase III, 6%. These values may reflect differences in the transcriptional activity of the nuclei. After isolation of nucleoli, both rat liver and ascites polymerase I accounted for 85% of enzyme activity. When exogenous calf-thymus DNA was added to nucleoli, there was a greater than 50% increase in activity suggesting that less than one-half of the polymerase I present was bound to endogenous template. Polymerase I was solubilized from either rat liver or ascites nucleoli by sonication at high ionic strength and subsequently purified by ion filtration, phosphocellulose, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and DNA-cellulose chromatography.

No such ATPase was found in the rabbit duct, which normally does not secrete HCO-3. The HCO-3ATPase was localized in the plasma membrane fraction of the homogenate, as evidenced by the marker 5'nucleotidase. The activities of the HCO-3ATPase increased in metabolic alkalosis and decreased in metabolic acidosis in parallel to secretion of HCO-3 and K+ ions by the rat salivary duct epithelium. In renal cortex tissue, where HCO-3 is actively reabsorbed respectively H+ is secreted, there was also found a parallel change in the activity of the HCO-3ATPase and the rate of active H+ secretion. These findings provide further evidence that the membrane-bound HCO-3ATPase is involved in active H+/HCO-3 transport. The HCO-3ATPase is not only stimulated by HCO-3 but also by other non transportable oxybases, a finding which indicates H+ rather than HCO-3 being the actively transported component of the buffer system. Small concentrations of K+ ions decrease the Km for HCO-3 and thus yield stimulation of the HCO-3-ATPase.

Antihypertensive drug therapy, while decreasing overall mortality due to cerebral hemorrhage, myocardial hypertrophy or renal failure, paradoxically does not appear to reduce the incidence of coronary atherosclerosis. This study investigates whether the drugs, as a possible side effect, may have an adverse influence on the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Groups of rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet containing 1% cholesterol for 12 weeks. Two commonly used antihypertensive agents (methyldopa and chlorthalidone) were added to the diet of some groups at levels of 100 mg and 10 mg per day respectively. No significant increase in total atherosclerotic plaque area was produced by either of the drugs tested singly or in combination. Plasma renin levels were only mildly elevated and in this experimental system there was no correlation between renin activity and atherosclerotic plaque intensity. There is thus no evidence from this study that antihypertensive drugs have any adverse effects on atherosclerotic plaque formation.

In contrast, experiments reported herein show that considerable inhibitory activity can be regenerated as a time-dependent phenomena following titration to basic media. The rate of recovery of activity is accompanied by a decreasing amplitude in the fluorescent emission spectrum at 335 nm of acidified alpha-1-antitrypsin solutions following adjustment to pH 8.0. Acidic media also results in the slow, progressive formation of protein aggregates as measured using Sephadex gel filtration. This latter process is more prominent at pH 4.0, near the isoelectric point of alpha-1-antitrypsin than at pH 3 or 2. Both monomer and polymeric forms of alpha-1-antititrypsin were isolated before or after adjustment to basic media.

The effects of activators (decamethonium, carbamylcholine) and inhibitors (alpha-bungarotoxin, d-tubocurarine) of neural transmission on this reaction have been measured and the following new information obtained. (1) The irreversible reaction is preceded by the reversible formation of toxin-receptor complexes. (2) Two types of receptor binding site exist. d-Tubocurarine directly competes with the toxin for one type of binding site. Decamethonium and carbamylcholine are noncompetitive inhibitors of the toxin reaction. (3) The data are inconsistent with binding sites on separate and distinct molecules or with preexisting nonequivalent binding sites. A simple model is proposed to explain both the kinetic data and equilibrium measurements which indicated that activators and inhibitors of neural transmission compete for only one-half of the receptor sites available to them. The model proposes that for the compounds investigated the binding sites of activators do not overlap with those of inhibitors and the ligand-induced conformational changes of the receptor result in changes in the affinities of the binding sites.

{"title": "Caudate stimulation and substantia nigra activity in the rat.", "abstract": "1. The responses of spontaneously active single neurones in the substantia nigra and overlying mesencephalic reticular formation have been analysed during the electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral caudate nucleus. Experiments were performed in rats anaesthetized with urethane or pentobarbitone. All recordings were made extracellularly with multi-barrelled glass micropipettes which were also used to test neuronal responsiveness to electrophoretically administered substances. The micropipette tip position was marked and the distribution of neurones studied has been analysed. 2. Single shock stimulation of the caudate nucleus inhibited neuronal activity in the substantia nigra (270/320 cells: mean latency 5-4 msec) and in the mesencephalic reticular formation (62/72 cells: mean latency 16-6 msec). However, these effects were often accompanied by periods of excitation. In pentobarbitone anaesthetized animals the latency and duration of these substantia nigra inhibitions was increased. 3. Compared with the zona reticulata, fewer neurones in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra responded to caudate stimulation in both urethane or pentobarbitone anaesthetized animals. 4. The activity of most cells was depressed by electrophoretically administered GABA or glycine and increased by acetylcholine or glutamate. Neurones of the mesencephalic reticular formation were less sensitive to GABA and glycine than substantia nigra neurones. Within the substantia nigra, both zona compacta and zona reticulata neurones were more sensitive to GABA than to glycine. Over-all, glutamate was a more potent excitant than acetylcholine (ACh). 5. Electrophoretic bicuculline methochloride (BMC) consistently reduced GABA but not glycine depression of substantia nigra neurones. Approximately twice as much BMC was required to reduce the endogenous inhibition of the same substantia nigra neurones and the amplitude of concomitantly evoked positive field potential as was required to abolish exogenous GABA responses. Some evoked substantia nigra inhibitions were resistant to BMC. 6. Electrophoretic strychnine consistently reduced glycine but not GABA depression of substantia nigra neurones, and did not modify caudate evoked inhibition of these neurones or the accompanying field potential. 7. The results support the concept of a slowly conducting caudato-nigral pathway which has both facilitatory and inhibitory components. The inhibitory pathway uses GABA as the neurotransmitter. The identity of the possible excitatory transmitter is unknown. The monosynaptic nature of this pathway is uncertain and the possible contribution of other bicuculline insensitive nigral inhibitory processes is discussed.", "pmid": "8637", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000758 D000818 D001640 D001931 D002421 D004558 D008297 D008636 D009474 D018377 D010424 D051381 D012154 D013331 D013378 D014520", "score": 29.85307, "rank": 502, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

It was found that the major kinetic effect of the phosphorylation was to reduce the affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, K0.5 for this substrate increasing from 0.3 to 0.9 mM upon phosphorylation. The cooperative effect with phosphoenolpyruvate was enhanced, the Hill constant nH increasing concomitantly from 1.1 to 1.5. V was unaltered. The change in activity occurred in parallel with the phosphate incorporation, except during the initial part of the reaction, when inactivation was correspondingly slower. The affinity for the second substrate ADP was unchanged, with an apparent Km of 0.3 mM at saturating concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate. Likewise, the requirement for potassium was unaffected, whereas the phosphoenzyme required a higher concentration of magnesium ions for maximal activity, compared with the control enzyme. The inhibitory effect of the phosphorylation was counteracted by positive effectors, fructose 1,6-biphosphate in micromolar concentrations completely activated the phosphoenzyme, resulting in an enzyme with properties similar to the fructose 1,6-biphosphate-activated unphosphorylated enzyme, with K0.5 for phosphoenolpyruvate about 0.025 mM and with a Hill constant of 1.1. Hydrogen ions were also effective in activating the phosphoenzyme. Thus, when pH was lowered from 8 to 6.5 the inhibition due to phosphorylation was abolished. The phosphoenzyme was sensitive to further inhibition by negative effectors such as ATP and alanine. 2 mM ATP increased K0.5 for phosphoenolpyruvate to 1.5 mM and nH to 2.3.

It has been found that only the neutral form of 2,4-D is transport active, whereas the ionized from of 2,4-D does not modify transport of ions, and does not by itself permeate through lipid membranes. The results suggest that the enhancement of transport of positively charged ions such as tetraphenylarsonium + and nonactin-K+ is dominated by the increase of the ion translocation rate constant. It has been shown that the enhancement of nonactin-mediated transport of K+ by 2,4-D can be accounted for by a simple carrier model. We have observed that a 2,4-D concentration above 3 X 10(-4) M the potassium ion transport in phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol as well as in cholesterol-free glycerolmonooleate membranes is enhanced to such a degree that, depending upon the concentration of potassium ions, it becomes limited by the rate of recombination of K+ with nonactin, and/or by backdiffusion of unloaded nonactin molecules. Furthermore, the effect of 2,4-D is enhanced by ionic strength of aqueous solution. From the changes of kinetic parameters of nonactin-K+ transport, as well as from the changes of membranes conductance due to tetraphenylarsonium + ions, we have estimated the changes of the electrical potential of the membrane interior. We have found that the potential of the interior of the membrane becomes more negative in the presence of 2,4-D, and that its change is proportional to the aqueous concentration of 2,4-D. The effect of 2,4-D on ion transport has been attributed to a layer of 2,4-D molecules absorbed within the interfacial region, and having a dipole moment directed toward the aqueous medium. The results of kinetic studied of nonactin-K+ transport suggest that this layer is located on the hydrocarbon side of the interface.", "pmid": "263687", "mesh_set": "D015084 D000900 D001692 D004553 D007700 D008051 D018942 D008433 D008954 D011188", "score": 12.490766, "rank": 5618, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Stimulation of the hypothalamic defence area inhibits the bradycardia produced by sinus nerve stimulation both in intact animals and also in animals with the spinal cord sectioned at C1 or C6. This inhibition was accompanied in the normal animal by an increased sympathetic discharge and by a sustained inspiration or tachypnoea. The same respiratory effects were noted in a spontaneously breathing C6 spinal animal, while an artificially ventilated C1 spinal animal still displayed a powerful central inspiratory drive in its recurrent laryngeal electroneurogram. The presence of central inspiratory activity was found to be an absolute impediment to the development of bradycardia. If this activity was eliminated by simultaneous stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve, it was possible to obtain bradycardia during combined sinus nerve and hypothalamic defence area stimulation, though this bradycardia was modified by the presence of sympathetic discharge. The level of sympathetic neural discharge affects the magnitude of the bradycardia produced by sinus nerve stimulation. The bradycardia was less with normal or augmented level of sympathetic activity and was greater if this activity was reduced or absent. A lesion just caudal to the mammillary bodies disclosed a tonic hypothalamic influence both on respiration and on sympathetic discharge; stimulation of the sinus nerve produced a much more powerful bradycardia after the lesion.

The assay utilizes selective ion detection to monitor in a GLC effluent the MH+ molecular ions of amitriptyline and nortriptyline generated by isobutane chemical ionization. The procedure, which utilizes deuterated analogs of amitriptyline and nortriptyline as internal standards, requires 1 ml of plasma and can measure 1 ng/ml of amitriptyline and 0.5 ng/ml of nortriptyline. The curves relating the amounts of amitriptyline and nortriptyline added versus the amounts found over a 100-fold range of amitriptyline and nortriptyline concentrations are straight lines with intercepts of approximately zero and slopes of unity. Analyses of plasma samples from three subjects receiving 50 mg of amitriptyline orally, three times a day, gave an average plasma concentration of 115 +/- 42 ng/ml for amitriptyline and 109 +/- 20 ng/ml for nortriptyline.

The pH optima for the sulphation of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethylene glycol and 4-methylumbelliferone are 7.8 and 7.4 respectively. Substrate inhibition by the sulphate acceptor is apparent at concentrations over 0.05mM. Initial-velocity studies in the absence and presence of product and dead-end inhibitors suggested that the mechanism of the rat brain sulphotransferase reaction is sequential ordered Bi Bi with a dead-end complex of enzyme with adenosine 3',5'-biphosphate and sulphate acceptor. The sulphate donor adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-sulphatophosphate is the first substrate that adds to the enzyme, and the sulphate acceptor is the second substrate.

As a rule, there were poorly collateralized occlusions at several levels in the severe stages of the peripheral blood-flow disorders. Venous occlusion plethysmography shows a pathological profile of reactive hyperemia. The parameters of resting blood flow in the severe stages were not found to be lowered in any patient; their average value was higher than that of a healthy comparison group (60 limbs). The oxygen saturation in the femoral vein in almost equal to that in the femoral artery in the exercise period in these severe stages, i.e. no oxygen utilization takes place in the periphery. While a rise in various enzyme activities could be observed after ergometric exercise in patients in stage II according to Fontaine, this is not possible in stages III and IV. There were no significant differences in measurements of the arteriovenous lactate-pyruvate difference, the pO2, the pH, the standard bicarbonate the hematocrit and the viscometry. In the severe stages, there is thus a situation of anaerobic metabolism and an accumulation of acid metabolites. An attempt is made to explain why a systematically perfomed vasodilatation has no positive effect but can lead to undesired side-effects such as a borrowing-lending phenomenon. Intra-arterial vasodilatation with short-acting vasodilators can only lead to a necessary blood-flow when the vascular occlusion is compensated by a well collateralized cirulation. In the severe stages, a fall in the perfusion pressure and blocking of the terminal blood vessel is possible. In advanced stages of a blood flow disorder it is therefore necessar during the first infusion to demonstrate by venous plethymography a quantitative increase in blood flow and to exclude a local peripheral steal effect.

Infection with P3 virus was accompanied by minimal bronchitis and bronchiolitis only, whereas P9-infected animals exhibited marked bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Striking thymic cortical atrophy was also demonstrable in the P9-infected animals and, although virus was more commonly recovered from thymuses from these animals, immunofluorescent studies revealed only a few cells containing influenza virus antigens. To further explore the participation of thymus-derived lymphocytes in influenza, athymic nude mice and furred immunocompetent littermates were given 500 50% mouse infectious doses of P9 virus. Nude mice exhibited an increased survival time and, in contrast to the extensive lung pathology seen in furred littermates, manifested minimal cellular infiltration and no tissue destruction in lungs. Brains from nude mice exhibited encephalomalacia with lymphocytic perivascular cuffing, which was not seen in furred animals.

The optimal pH for enzyme activity is 8.0. The molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be 116,000, based on measurements of the sedimentation coefficient by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and the Stokes radius by gel filtration. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cross-linked OTCase in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed that the enzyme is composed of three identical subunits. The molecular weight of the monomer was determined to be 39,000. Steady-state kinetics indicate that the reaction mechanism is sequential. The limiting Michealis constants for carbamylphosphate and ornithine were determined to be 0.06 and 0.2 mM, respectively. The dissociation constant for carbamylphosphate was 0.02 mM. Product and dead-end inhibition patterns are consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, in which carbamylphosphate is the first substrate added and phosphate is the last product released. OTCase activity was inhibited by arginine, but relatively high concentrations were required for significant inhibition. The inhibition by arginine might be physiologically significant in the regulation of carbamlphosphate utilization; a single carbamylphosphate synthetase is responsible for the synthesis of carbamylphosphate for both arginine and pyrimidines in S. typhimurium and the inhibition by argine might serve to divert carbamlphosphate to the synthesis of pyrimidines when arginine is present at high concentrations. The crossreaction of OTCases from different microorganisms with purified antibodies raised against the homogeneous OTCase from S. typhimurium was investigated. The results of immunotitration and immunodiffusion experiments revealed a high degree of identity between the enzymes form S. typhimurium and Esherichia coli B and W. In these three cases, a single gen (argl) encodes OTCase. Wild-type E. coli K-12 and strain 3000 X 111, which carry two OTCase genes (argI, argF), also revealed similar cross-reactivity, supporting the hypothesis that argF is the product of a relatively recent duplication. The activity of OTCase from Bacillus subtilis was partially inhibited by antibodies against the enzyme from S. typhimurium, indicating unusual conservation of primary structure among widely different taxonomic groups.

Thus, the defect in oxidation of the number one carbon atom of glucose (pentose pathway oxidation) is distal to the 2-deoxyglucose uptake system. However, this intracellular defect is not present in all pathways of glucose oxidation as demonstrated by the finding that [6(-14)C]glucose oxidation was comparable in small and large adipocytes. Thus, the number six carbon atom of glucose is oxidized normally indicating that glycolytic and Krebs cycle activity is intact in the large adipocyte. Furthermore, in large adipocytes conversion of glucose to total lipid was normal in the basal state and moderately decreased at high glucose concentrations in the presence of insulin (up to 35%). When the radioactivity in total lipids was fractionated, a severe decrease in glucose incorporation into fatty acids was found in the large cells. Total glucose uptake was also measured, and found to be 10-50% decreased in large cells, suggesting that the decreases in pentose pathway glucose metabolism and conversion to fatty acids lead to accumulation of free intracellular glucose with glucose efflux and a decrease in net glucose uptake. Comparing the 2-deoxyglucose uptake and glucose oxidation data showed that insulin promotes [6(-14)C]glucose oxidation by stimulating the processes responsible for 2-deoxyglucose uptake whereas insulin promotes [1(-14)C]glucose oxidation both by increasing these processes and by increasing the activity of the C-1 oxidative pathway.", "pmid": "837879", "mesh_set": "D000273 D000818 D003847 D004285 D005227 D005947 D005989 D066298 D007328 D007333 D008055 D008297 D009765 D010084 D051381", "score": 13.73858, "rank": 5183, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The effects studied were: (1) flow in the ascending aorta and the coronary, common hepatic, gastroduodenal, splenic, cranial mesenteric, renal and femoral arteries: (2) maximal flow acceleration in the splenic, cranial mesenteric and femoral arteries; (3) maximal rate of change of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max). Propranolol shifted the dose-response curves for the isoproterenol-induced flow increases in the common hepatic, gastro-duodenal, and cranial mesenteric arteries to the right. It did not influence the flow responses to isoproterenol in the ascending aorta or the coronary, splenic, renal and femoral arteries. Propranolol prevented the decrease of arterial pressure evoked by isoproterenol. Propranolol shifted the isoproterenol-induced increase of LV dP/dt max and maximal blood flow to the same extent. Propranolol blocked the flow to the liver and gastrointestinal tract to a greater extent than the LV dP/dt max and maximal flow acceleration. Propranolol had no effect on the norepinephrine-induced increases in flow in the splenic, femoral and coronary arteries, but blocked the norepinephrine-evoked increases of flow accelerations and LV dP/dt max to the same extent. Dihydroergotamine inhibited the norepinephrine-induced increase in flow in the femoral artery and the decreases in flow in the hepatic, splenic, cranial mesenteric and renal arteries, and reversed the reduction of flow in the gastroduodenal artery. It is argued that dihydroergotamine may inhibit the increase in femoral flow through two mechanisms: (1) blocking the flow reduction to norepinephrine in the abdomen, and thereby passively shunting blood from the abdomen in preference to the femoral bed; (2) attenuating the norepinephrine-evoked reflexogenic femoral vasodilatation. It is concluded that: (1) propranolol is a beta-receptor blocking agent with a preference for blockade of isoproterenol-induced vascular effects; (2) norepinephrine-induced flow increases are not direct actions on vascular beta-receptors; (3) the increase of maximal blood flow accelerations after isoproterenol and norepinephrine is mediated by stimulation of cardiac beta-receptors; (4) dihydroergotamine is an alpha-receptor blocking agent particularly in the splanchnic vascular region.", "pmid": "28954", "mesh_set": "D000317 D000319 D000818 D001775 D003326 D004087 D004285 D004562 D005260 D005269 D007545 D008297 D009638 D011433 D012039 D013997", "score": 19.097813, "rank": 2590, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

After a 3-h restraint stress ulcerative changes were observed in the stomach of sham-operated rats.

Pretreatment of sham-operated controls with tetrabenazine enhanced the stress-induced decrease of NA in the brain, and exacerbated the gastric ulceration.

Blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol did not change this secretion. Practolol in small doses slightly increased and in larger doses inhibited HCl out-put. Of the catecholamines, adrenaline and dopamine most markedly reduced HCl and pepsin secretion, while noradrenaline and isoprenaline had a weaker effect. Neither alpha- nor beta-adrenergic blockers prevented the inhibitory action of the catecholamines employed, but intensified the depression of the gastric secretion provoked by them. Adrenergic blockers inhibited secretion after catecholamines as well as basal secretion.

Thus, it seems to be established that anaesthesia per se influences renin secretion. On the other hand Practolol does not show an inhibiting effect. The plasma renin increase following anaesthesia is due to the hemodynamic including renal hemodynamic, changes as well as to activation of the sympatho-adrenal system. Changes in plasma aldosterone are variable. For the greater part of patients with beta-adrenergic blockade an increase during the operative procedure was found.

It was shown that in the red blood cells of uraemics a genuine increase of the concentration of these compounds occurs, in which case the adenosine triphosphate dominates absolutely as well as relatively. In individual cases erytho-cyctic ATP-values of more than 3 micron mol pro ml cells may be achieved. The increase of the ATP-concentration in the red blood cells correlates with the degree of severity of the renal insufficiency and the renal anaemia. The hyperphosphataemia occurring as a rule in renal insuficiency is of causal importance for the increase of ATP. By a consecutive increase of the intracellular phosphate level and by influence on different steps of enzymes (phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glycerin aldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase) and changed regulations it effected an activation of the glycolysis. The increase of the plasma adenine and plasma adenosine concentration plays apparantly an accessory role for the increase of the concentration of the adenine nucleotides existing in the erythrocytes. Together with an increased concentration of 2,3-diphosphogycerate (2,3-DPG) the increase of the ATP-level has an effect on the oxygen transport function function of haemoglobin in the sense of a facilitation of the O2-output.

Only 4% developed odor when the sponge was removed within 24 hours after intercourse, rinsed, and reinserted. While sexually active volunteers found odor in 37% of the sponges, odor formed only in 4% of the sponges worn by sexually inactive users. No difference in the rate of odor formation was found when neutral pH (7.0) and acid pH (3.4) collagen sponges were tested, although we believe that a pH 3.4 is too acid and promotes odor formation. The optimal pH of the sponge should be 4.5 to 5.5. Malodor was efficiently extracted from sponges by washing in acid milieu of tap water and vinegar or 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Alkali extraction procedures were ineffective, and lukewarm water was slightly less effective than acid extraction of odor. At the time of malodor development, the high content of polyamines (putrescine, spermine, spermidine) in the ejaculate decreased to undetectable values. We conclude that the ejaculate is the major source of malodor formation in intravaginally worn collagen sponges.

R. & Chock, P. B. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 2761-2770]. Because glutamine and alpha-ketoglutarate are multifunctional effectors and because three active enzyme complexes are involved in both adenylylation and deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase, at least 28 constants are required to describe the glutamine synthetase monocyclic cascade. Of these, 22 constants were determined experimentally and 6 were estimated via computer curve fitting. Despite the complexity, when both adenylylation and deadenylylation reactions are functioning, the number of adenylyl groups bound per mole of enzyme, n, assumes a steady-state level as is predicted by the model. This n value is determined by the mole fraction of P(IIA)-given by ([P(IIA)]/([P(IIA)] + [P(IID)])-and the ratio of glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate (P(IID) and P(IID) are the unmodified and the uridylylated forms of the P(II) regulatory protein). In the presence of 0.5 mM glutamine and 2 mM alpha-ketoglutarate, the value of n increases as a nearly hyperbolic function in response to increasing mole fractions of P(IIA). When the constant level of alpha-ketoglutarate is gradually increased to 40 muM, the hyperbolic function converts slowly to a parabolic function. When the P(IIA) mole fraction was maintained at 0.6 and alpha-ketoglutarate levels were varied from 1 mM to 4 muM, an 800-fold increase in signal amplification was observed with respect to glutamine activation. In addition, because glutamine activates the adenylylation and inhibits the deadenylylation reaction, a sensitivity index of 2.1 (corresponding to a Hill number of 1.5) was obtained for the variation of n values in response to increasing glutamine concentration.", "pmid": "28522", "mesh_set": "D000249 D000494 D004926 D005974 D005973 D007656 D007700 D008954 D009713 D013329 D014542", "score": 21.892103, "rank": 1640, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Transport of simple monocarboxylic acids, including acetate and propionate, was insensitive to these inhibitors; they presumably cross the membrane by means of a different mechanism. 6. Experiments using saturating amounts of mersalyl as an \"inhibitor stop\" allowed measurements of the initial rates of net influx and of net efflux of [14C]lactate. Influx and efflux of lactate were judged to be symmetrical reactions in that they exhibited similar concentration dependence. 7.

Alkaline digestion of the 3H-protein released 0.1 to 0.3% of the 3H as a derivative that was identified as 3'-methylmercaptoisosafrole by its cochromatography in five solvent systems with the synthetic compound. 1'-Hydroxysafrole was metabolized at a low rate by rat and mouse liver cytosols in a 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate-dependent reaction to a derivative (presumably the sulfuric acid ester) that was captured by its reaction with RNA. Likewise, 1'-hydroxysafrole was oxidized at a low rate by rat and mouse liver microsomes to 1'-hydroxysafrole-2',3'-oxide in a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent reaction.

The view that this is a result of modification of a protein thiol group is re-examined in the light of the following new observations. (i) After treatment with phenylmercuric acetate, the enzyme's ability to be re-greened by addition of thiols was not decreased by gel filtration or precipitation with (NH(4))(2)SO(4). (ii) Phenylmercuric acetate caused the same extent of de-greening whether added in a few large amounts or many small ones. The overall time taken for de-greening was, however, greatly extended when many small additions were made. (iii) In Tris/acetate buffer, pH7.5, 3.5mol of phenylmercuric acetate/mol of enzyme subunit was required for complete de-greening, compared with only 2.5mol/mol in phosphate buffer, pH7. (iv) None of the groups that react with phenylmercuric acetate is accessible to iodoacetate or iodoacetamide. (v) On a molar basis dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol and CoA are equally effective in re-greening the enzyme. (vi) Provided that phenylmercuric acetate is not present in excess, the de-greened enzyme forms normal and stable complexes with crotonyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA. (vii) When a small excess of phenylmercuric acetate is present, full stable development of the enzyme-acetoacetyl-CoA complex requires addition of several mol of acetoacetyl-CoA/mol of enzyme subunit. (viii) The ability of de-greened enzyme to be immediately re-greened by an excess of thiol declines with time, more rapidly at pH6 than at pH7 or 8, but at all three pH values the instantaneous re-greening was followed by a slow phase of further increase in A(710). This further recovery was most extensive and most rapid at pH8. These findings are reminiscent of the previously described reversible decline in the re-greening capacity of a protein-free acid extract of green butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. It is concluded that the likely cause of de-greening is chemical modification of the tightly bound thioester rather than a protein thiol group. The reversibility would be explained if the thioester exists on the surface of the enzyme in equilibrium with free CoA and a lactone, or if the acyl group is readily and reversibly transferred from the thiol of CoA to a protein side chain.", "pmid": "25661", "mesh_set": "D000214 D000645 D002850 D006863 D010088 D010662 D010663 D013053 D013438 D013997", "score": 8.872643, "rank": 6109, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The range of DNA single-strand lengths that can be discriminated by elution above the alkaline transition pH was estimated by calibration relative to the effects of x ray, and was found to be 5 X 10(8)-10(10) daltons.

{"title": "[Isolation, purification and characterization of regulatory properties of adenylate cyclase from rabbit heart].", "abstract": "Rabbit heart membranes possessing the adenylate cyclase activity were isolated and purified by extraction with high ionic strength solutions and centrifugation in the sucrose density gradient. It was shown that the membranes are characterized by a high percentage of cholesterol (molar ratio cholesterol/phospholipids is 0.24) and an increased activity of Na, K-ATPase, which suggests the localization of adenylate cyclase in the sarcolemma. During centrifugation in the sucrose density gradient the activities of andenylate cyclase and Na,K-ATPase are not separated. Treatment of heart sarcolemma with a 0.3% solution of lubrol WX results in 10--20% solubilization of adenylate cyclase. Purification of the enzyme in the membrane fraction is accompanied by a decrease in the activity of phosphodiesterase; however, about 2% of the heart diesterase total activity cannot be removed from the sarcolemma even after its treatment with 0.3% lubrol WX. Epinephrine and NaF activate adenylate cyclase without changing the pH dependence of the enzyme. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine has no effect on the adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamines, glucagon and histamine; the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol competitively inhibits the effects of isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine, having no effect on the enzyme activation by glucagon and histamine. There is no competition between epinephrine, glucagon and histamine for the binding site of the hormone; however, there may occur a competition between the hormone receptors for the binding to the enzyme. A combined action of several hormones on the membranes results in the averaging of their individual activating effects. When the hormones were added one after another, the extent of adenylate cyclase activation corresponded to that induced by the first hormone; the activation was insensitive to the effect of the second hormone added. It is assumed that the outer membrane of myocardium cells contains a adenylate cyclase and three types of receptors, each being capable to interact with the same form of enzyme.

Samples were taken at rest, immediately after termination of dynamic exercise and during 20 min recovery from exhaustive dynamic exercise. Muscle pH decreases from 7.08 atrest to 6.60 at exhaustion. Decrease in muscle pH was linearly related to muscle content of lactate + pyruvate.

{"title": "Determination of transmitter function by neuronal activity.", "abstract": "The role of neuronal activity in the determination of transmitter function was studied in cultures of dissociated sympathetic neurons from newborn rat superior cervical ganglia. Cholinergic and adrenergic differentiation were assayed by incubating the cultures with radioactive choline and tyrosine and determining the rate of synthesis and accumulation of labelled acetylcholine and catecholamines. As in previous studies, pure neuronal cultures grown in control medium displayed much lower ratios of acetylcholine synthesis to catecholamine synthesis than did sister cultures grown in medium previously conditioned by incubation on appropriate nonneuronal cells (conditioned medium). However, here we report that neurons treated with the depolarizing agents elevated K(+) or veratridine, or stimulated directly with electrical current, either before or during application of conditioned medium, displayed up to 300-fold lower acetylcholine/catecholamine ratios than they would have without depolarization, and thus remained primarily adrenergic. Elevated K(+) and veratridine produced this effect on cholinergic differentiation without significantly altering neuronal survival. Because depolarization causes Ca(2+) entry in a number of cell types, the effects of several Ca(2+) agonists and antagonists were investigated. In the presence of the Ca(2+) antagonists D600 or Mg(2+), K(+) did not prevent the induction of cholinergic properties by conditioned medium. Thus depolarization, either steady or accompanying activity, is one of the factors determining whether cultured sympathetic neurons become adrenergic or cholinergic, and this effect may be mediated by Ca(2+).", "pmid": "272002", "mesh_set": "D000109 D000320 D000344 D000818 D002395 D002454 D002799 D004558 D005725 D066298 D011188 D051381 D013116 D014701", "score": 21.932653, "rank": 1628, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The bioassay used depends upon the ability of GH in vitro to stimulate the uptake of 3-0-methyl glucose (3-OMG) into the isolated diaphragm of the hypophysectomized rat. It was found that the effect of the diluted plasma on this system was qualitatively like that of rat pituitary GH. Theophylline, a drug which blocks the action of GH on 3-OMG uptake by the diaphragm but has no effect on the actions of insulin or somatomedin on this process, completely abolished the stimulatory action of the plasma on the transport of the sugar. Furthermore, antibodies against rat pituitary GH (ArGH) completely abolished the biological activity of the diluted plasma. When plasma was diluted to give specific concentrations of rat GH (rGH), as determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA), the plasma produced responses in the 3-OMG assay equivalent to those obtained with similar concentrations of pituitary rGH. A good correlation was also observed between the concentration of rGH in the plasma of tumor-bearing rats measured by RIA and by an in vivo bioassay in which the effects were determined of injections of diluted plasma into hypophysectomized rats on the subsequent incorporation of [3H]thymidine into costal cartilage. This in vivo biological activity was abolished by incubation of the plasma with ArGH prior to its injection into the test animals.

All seven acridines tested were mutagenic at the amiA locus conferring a resistance to 10(-5) M aminopterin. The effects of quinacrine were more specifically investigated. It was observed that: mutants can be obtained only by treatment of exponentially growing cells; a sharp maximum mutagenic effect occurs at a concentration slightly lower than the bacteriostatic value; and the amount of quinacrine required to yield the maximum mutagenic effect decreases with the pH of the medium. Moreover, the number of mutants detected after quinacrine treatment varies from locus to locus. The majority of quinacrine-induced mutants are readily reverted by quinacrine, but not by nitrosoguanidine treatment. This suggests that in pneumococcus quinacrine induces mainly frameshift mutations. A further study of the revertants obtained by quinacrine treatment of quinacrine-induced mutants strengths this interpretation: most of the revertants result from a mutation at the same site; some partial revertants exhibiting an intermediate resistance to aminopterin were found to contain two very closely linked mutated sites, each mutation conferring the maximum level of resistance to aminopterin. Thus, the majority of quinacrine-induced mutants at the amiA locus of pneumococcus consists of frameshift mutations. Nearly all of the isolated mutants induced by quinacrine as well as other acridines belong to the low efficiency class of transformation. It was concluded that the mismatch resulting from the pairing between the wild type and the frameshift-containing sequence is recognized by the excision-repair system involved in the discrimination function in a way similar to that in which it recognizes mismatched base pairs between a transition mutation and the wild-type sequence.", "pmid": "29824", "mesh_set": "D000166 D000630 D004352 D005815 D009153 D009154 D011796 D013296 D014158", "score": 11.232253, "rank": 5918, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "The kinetics of the reduction of cytochrome c by the superoxide anion radical.", "abstract": "1. At neutral pH ferricytochrome c is reduced by the superoxide anion radical (O2-), without loss of enzymatic activity, by a second order process in which no intermediates are observed. The yield of ferrocytochrome c (82-104%), as related to the amount of O2- produced, is slightly dependent on the concentration of sodium formate in the matrix solution. 2. The reaction (k1 equals (1.1+/-0.1) - 10(6) M-1 - s-1 at pH 7.2, I equals 4 mM and 21 degrees C) can be inhibited by superoxide dismutase and trace amounts of copper ions. The inhibition by copper ions is removed by EDTA without interference in the O2- reduction reaction. 3. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of O2- with ferricytochrome c depends on the pH of the matrix solution, decreasing rapidly at pH greater than 8. The dependence of the rate constant on the pH can be explained by assuming that only the neutral form of ferricytochrome c reacts with O2- and that the alkaline form of the hemoprotein is unreactive. From studies at pH 8.9, the rate for the transition from the alkaline to the neutral form of ferricytochrome c can be estimated to be 0.3 s-1 (at 21 degrees C and I equals 4 mM). 4. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of O2- with ferricytochrome c is also dependent on the ionic strength of the medium.

A significant increase in serum prolactin was observed after subcutaneous administration of the drug. Although sulpiride (0-10 micronmol/1 or 0-14 mmol/1) had no effect on the secretion of newly synthesized or radioimmunoassayable prolactin in vitro, the drug significantly overcame the inhibitory action that dopamine (0-50 micronmol/1) exerted on prolactin secretion. Rats implanted with a prolactin-secreting pituitary tumour MtTW15 showed an inhibition of prolactin biosynthesis and release. Injection of these rats with sulpiride restored prolactin biosynthesis and release of the hormone toward normal levels. These results demonstrate that sulpiride has a direct effect on the pituitary antagonizing the inhibitory effects exerted by dopaminergic mechanisms, although the drug itself does not stimulate the secretion of prolactin in vitro.

Homogenates prepared in 250 mM sucrose at pH 7.0 showed a 40% increase in protein breakdown. These data support the hypothesis that the induced increase in proteolysis, characteristic of cells placed in a nutritionally deficient medium, is effected by an activated vacuolar apparatus (lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles). We suggest, however, that this mechanism is distinct from normal protein turnover in the cell, but can be rapidly induced by appropriate alterations in the cellular environment.

{"title": "Stimulation of pyruvate transport in metabolizing mitochondria through changes in the transmembrane pH gradient induced by glucagon treatment of rats.", "abstract": "Glucagon treatment of rats allowed the isolation of liver mitochondria with enhanced rates of pyruvate metabolism measured in either sucrose or KCl media. No change in the activity of the pyruvate carrier itself was apparent, but under metabolizing conditions, use of the inhibitor of pyruvate transport, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, demonstrated that pyruvate transport limited the rate of pyruvate metabolism. The maximum rate of transport under metabolizing conditions was enhanced by glucagon treatment. Problems involved in measuring the transmembrane pH gradient under metabolizing conditions are discussed and a variety of techniques are used to estimate the matrix pH. From the distribution of methylamine, ammonia and D-lactate and the Ki for inhibition by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate it is concluded that the matrix is more acid than the medium and that the pH of the matrix rises after glucagon treatment. The increase in matrix pH stimulates pyruvate transport. The membrane potential, ATP concentration and O2 uptake were also increased under metabolizing conditions in glucagon-treated mitochondria. These changes were correlated with a stimulation of the respiratory chain which can be observed in uncoupled mitochondria [Yamazaki (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7924--7930].

{"title": "Post-tetanic enhancement of stimulus-induced muscarinic afterdischarge in the rat superior cervical ganglion.", "abstract": "The enhancement of asynchronous muscarinic ganglionic firing which follows a preganglionic nerve stimulus volley by high frequency repetitive conditioning stimuli was studied in the rat isolated superior cervical ganglion. Muscarinic afterdischarge which occurred in chlorisondamine-blocked ganglia was enhanced for up to 1 hr after a 40 Hz conditioning volley lasting 7.5 to 30 sec. Enhancement did not occur when release of acetylcholine was blocked by reducing the calcium in the modified Krebs' solution or when magnesium or manganese chlorides were added to the saline during the conditioning period. Metabolic inhibitors, dinitrophenol, sodium azide and ouabain, blocked the enhancement process but not the asynchronous muscarinic firing. Phenytoin, 10(-6) M, did not reduce the enhancement of firing. Dopamine, 5 X 10(-5) M, had no effect on muscarinic afterdischarge, but dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, 5 and 10 X 10(=3) M, caused a 43 and 53% increase in the maximum amplitude of afterdischarge. Dibutyryl cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate had no effect on post-tetanic enhancement or afterdischarge in concentrations up to 1 X 10(-3) M. A working hypothesis is proposed: following a conditioning stimulus, a prolonged postsynaptic change occurs which results in an increased responsiveness to muscarinic agonists, and this change probably involves a metabolic reaction since it is reduced by metabolic inhibitors.

E.p.r. (electron-paramagnetic-resonance) spectra of the fluoride, azide, hydroxide and cyanide complexes of these ferric leghaemoglobins were very similar to the spectra of the corresponding myoglobin derivatives, indicating that the immediate environment of the iron in leghaemoglobin and myoglobin is similar, an imidazole moiety of histidine being the proximal ligand to the haem iron [cf. Appleby, Blumberg, Peisach, Wittenberg & Wittenberg (1976) J. Biol. Chem.251, 6090-6096]. 3. E.p.r. spectra of the acid-metleghaemoglobins showed prominent high-spin features very near g=6 and g=2 and, unlike myoglobin, small low-spin absorptions near g=2.26, 2.72 and 3.14. The width of the g=6 absorption derivative at 10-20K was about 4-4.5mT, similar to the value for acid-methaemoglobin. In contrast, a recently published (Appleby et al., 1976) spectrum of acid-metleghaemoglobin a had less high-spin character and a much broader absorption derivative around g=6. 4. E.p.r. spectra of ferric leghaemoglobin nicotinate and imidazole complexes suggest that the low-spin absorption near g=3.14 can be attributed to a trace of ferric leghaemoglobin nicotinate, and those near g=2.26 and 2.72 are from an endogenous dihistidyl haemichrome. 5.

The fractions were characterized on the basis of hexose, hexosamine, sialic acid, and peptide content. The glycopeptide fraction from alpha1-acid glycoprotein is complex (i.e., the carbohydrate moiety contains mannose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and sailic acid), as is one of the glycopeptide fractions from thyroglobulin (type I). The glycopeptide fraction from ovalbumin and the type II glycopeptide fractions from thyroglobulin are simple (i.e., the carbohydrate moiety contains only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine). The circular dichroic spectra of the two complex glycopeptide fractions and the ovalbumin glycopeptide fraction were similar and were characterized by a negative extremum between 207.5 nm and 211 nm with magnitudes in the range of --6400 deg-cm2-dmol-1 to --7200 deg-cm2-dmol-1 (referred to the molar concentration of N-acetylated sugars). The thyroglubulin type II glycopeptide fraction exhibited a circular dichroic spectrum with an extremum of --29 200 deg-cm2-dmol-1 at 205 nm. Removal of sialic acid from the complex glycopeptide fractions greatly increased the (negative) magnitude of ellipticity at the extremum. The circular dichroic spectra of the complex of glycopeptide fractions were reasonably additive using the spectra of monomeric sialic acid and the asialo-derivatives. This demonstrates that the contributions of sialic acid to the circular dichroic spectrum are nearly additive. The implications of this observation are that covalent attachment of these terminal residues to the oligosaccharides does not lead to strong interactions with other chromophores nor to positioning in particularly asymmetric environment. In contrast, the magnitudes of the observed ellipticity extrema in the circular dichroic spectra of the asialo-derivatives, in which N-acetylglucosamine is the major chromophore, are much greater than can be accounted for on the basis of monomeric contributions (i.e., free N-acetylglucosamine). This finding shows that the optical activity of N-acetyl-glucosamine is greatly influenced by the formation of the carbohydrate core in glycoproteins and suggests the possible formation of secondary structure in the carbohydrate moiety.", "pmid": "849453", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D002241 D002417 D002645 D002942 D006020 D006023 D010047 D010446 D011402 D011487 D012794 D013954", "score": 14.654304, "rank": 4786, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Specific ions or salts also affect the rate of inactivation of enteroviruses. NaCl and other chloride salts enhance the inactivation of poliovirus at pH 3. NaCl is considerably less effective against poliovirus in the range of pH 4.5 to 7.0 than at pH less than 4.5. Loss of RNA infectivity of the virus particle proceeds as rapidly as the loss of infectivity of the particle itself, except at pH 3 in the presence of MgCl2.

Among the 459 patients who received lung cancer chemotherapy from April 2007 to March 2013, 33 (7.2%) developed chemotherapy-associated DILD.

{"title": "Tetramer-dimer dissociation in homoglobin and the Bohr effect.", "abstract": "The pH dependence of the apparent tetramer to dimer dissociation constant has been determined at 20 degrees for both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins A and Kansas. These measurements were made by three different procedures: gel chromatography, sedimentation velocity, and kinetic methods in either of three buffer systems: 0.05 M cacodylate, Tris, or glycine with 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 M NaCl between pH 6.5 and 11. The tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of human oxyhemoglobin A decreases from about 3.2 X 10(-6) M at pH 6.0 to about 3.2 X 10(-8) M at pH 8.5. The slope of this line indicates that the dissociation of tetramer to dimer is accompanied by the uptake of about 0.6 protons per mol of tetramer in this region. The corresponding dissociation constant for deoxyhemoglobin in the same pH region increases apparently almost linearly from 1.0 x 10(-12) M at pH 6.5 to about 1.0 x 10(-5) M at pH 11. To dimer is associated with the release of about 1.6 protons per mol of tetramer. Comparison of these data with the known proton release accompanying the oxygenation of tetramers confirms that the pH dependence of oxygen binding by dimers must be very small. The present data predict that the overall proton release or uptake per oxygen bound by dimer should be less than 0.1. The tetramer-dimer dissociation equilibria of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins above pH 8.5 have identical pH dependences. In this range the dissociation constant of deoxy-Hb is about one-tenth that of oxyhemoglobin. Human oxyhemoglobin Kansas is known to have an enhanced tetramer-dimer dissociation compared with that of hemoglobin A. Below pH 8.5 the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of Hb Kansas is about 400 times greater than that of HbA in the absence of phosphate buffers. In contrast, the tetramer-dimer dissociation constants of deoxyhemoglobins A and Kansas appear to be identical. These findings are consistent with previous structural observations on these hemoglobins. The data on the tetramer-dimer dissociation of human hemoglobin were used to calculate the total free energy of binding of oxygen to the tetramer and the median oxygen pressure on the basis of fundamental linkage relations and a pH-independent estimate of the total free energy of binding oxygen to dimer. Simulated oxygen binding curves were generated with the equations of Ackers and Halvorson (Ackers, G. K., and Halvorson, H. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71, 4312-4316) by making two assumptions: (a) that the dimers are noncooperative and pH-independent in O2 binding and (b) that the distribution of cooperative energy in the oxygenation of tetramers is independent of pH. We have compared these simulations with experimental data obtained at low protein concentrations (30 to 124 muM heme) to show that the variation in oxygen affinity with pH can be described in terms of the subunit equilibria. We conclude that an accurate analysis of the contributions of individual oxygen binding steps to the Bohr effect cannot be made without considering the contributions of the dimers to oxygen binding...", "pmid": "9390", "mesh_set": "D006454 D006455 D006801 D006863 D007615 D007700 D046911 D008433 D010108 D011485", "score": 12.628893, "rank": 5579, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The main findings were the same regardless of the gland source or experimental approach. Dextran was taken up initially via coated pits into smooth-surfaced apical vesicles. Shortly thereafter it was found in multiple cell compartments: within the stacked Golgi cisternae, in condensing vacuoles, and in lysosomes. Uptake was more rapid and uniform in vivo; dextran was seen in multiple cisternae of numerous Golgi complexes within 5 min after infusion. In acini incubated in vitro uptake into Golgi cisternae was more delayed and occurred with increasing frequency up to 60 min; also, more dextran was taken up into lysosomes, which were more numerous in vitro than in vivo. The results demonstrate that, after exocytosis, membrane is removed from the cell surface via vesicles that fuse with multiple cell compartments. The two novel findings are: (a) the demonstration that the tracer can reach most of the Golgi cisternae in a given stack and (b) the demonstration of the rapidity with which the process takes place (i.e., within 5 min). The findings imply that at least some membrane retrieved from the cell surface after exocytosis fuses with the stacked Golgi cisternae.", "pmid": "270741", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002462 D003911 D005089 D006056 D066298 D007545 D007765 D008247 D008297 D010306 D051381", "score": 14.951367, "rank": 4631, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In the presence of 0.4 M NaCl at pH 8.2 the co-operativity was positive at all phenylalanine concentrations and the maximal stoichiometry of 1 mol of phenylalanine/mol of enzyme subunit was observed. It was concluded that there is a single phenylalanine-binding site per subunit which is associated with the regulation of each of the mutase and dehydratase activities.

The retina was found to have a higher rate of base exchange for the incorporation of phospholipid bases than other tissues. The retinal microsomal fraction possessed the highest specific activity of base exchange, while the rod outer segment had very little activity. These results suggest that the phospholipids in the rod outer segment may be transferred from the inner segment of the photorecepter cell.

To determine the effect of inhibition of microtubule assembly on transport, colchicine or vinblastine sulfate was administered to postabsorptive rats, and the lipid and microtubule content of enterocytes determined 1 and 3 h later. After treatment with these agents, lipid was found to accumulate in apical regions of the cells; this event was associated with a significant reduction in microtubule content. In conclusion, the regional distribution of microtubules in enterocytes, the decrease in assembled microtubules after a fat-containing meal, and the accumulation of lipid after the administration of antimicrotubule agents suggest that microtubules are related to lipid transport in enterocytes.", "pmid": "264123", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004041 D005260 D007408 D007421 D050356 D008854 D008870 D051381 D011919", "score": 16.486883, "rank": 3834, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

A large fluorescence enhancement of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) observed in the presence of amylose was utilized to monitor quantitatively the time course of porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase [EC 3.2.1.1] (PPA)-catalyzed hydrolysis of amylose with a number-average degree of polymerization of 16.8. 2. The slope of the plot of decrease in the relative fluorescence intensity of the TNS-amylose system (termed as the fluorescence value) versus the number of linkages hydrolyzed (reducing value) (Kondo, H. et al. (1977) Agric. Biol. Chem. 41, 631-634) in the course of PPA-catalyzed hydrolysis was shown to be useful to describe the degree of \"multiple attack,\" which is defined by the number of reattacks on a long chain substrate molecular per one encounter of the enzyme and the substrate. A parameter gamma was defined as the ratio of the reciprocal of the slopes obtained at each pH to that at pH 10.5, where the multiple attack is not operating. 3. The gamma versus pH profile gave an apparent pK value of about 9, indicating that some ionizable groups participate in the multiple attack mechanism. 4. Based on a reaction scheme involving a \"sliding\" of the substrate molecule on the enzyme, which may contribute to the multiple attack mechanism, besides binding, dissociation, and cleavage steps of the substrate, and on the assumption of the steady state for the enzyme-substrate complex, rate equations were obtained to describe the time course of hydrolysis of a linear substrate. The product distribution with the progress of the reaction can be calculated theoretically, and is dependent on the number of multiple attack and the mode of sliding. The number of multiple attack can be estimated from this distribution, and the fluorescence value can be calculated theoretically by combining the product distribution with the relative efficiency of fluorescence intensity of each maltooligosaccharide (Nakatani, H. et. al. (1977) Biopolymers 16, 2363-2370). By comparing the experimental data with the theoretical ones, it was suggested that the multiple attack occurs through the sliding by maltose unit of the retained fragment on the enzyme, which is one of the fragments produced by the initial cleavage of the substrate molecule. 5.

This treatment was now found also to give rise to an ATP hydrolysis, which occurred without the need for activating ions in the incubation medium. This ATP hydrolysis should thus be described as nonspecific and, in terms of ion dependency, as due to a metalloenzyme, i.e. alkaline phosphatase. Activating ion dependent ATP hydrolysis in the dental tissues was found in the blood vessels and in the apical part of the secretory ameloblasts.

The extent to which the biphasic response adjusted to the steady state level was concentration-dependently increased KCl-responses and significantly decreased to a monophasic response to NA, in the presence of the beta-sympatholytic agents. 3.

The types of hypertensive rats were the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and a stroke-prone substrain of the SHR as well as DOCA-salt and renal hypertensive rats. The genetically hypertensive rats had significantly elevated blood pressures as compared to the Wistar-Kyoto control rat after 5 weeks of age. During the early development of hypertension in the SHR, the activities of tyrosine hydroxylase in the hypothalamus and corpus striatum and of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase in the hypothalamus and pons-medulla were significantly higher than in the control rats. Tryptophan-hydroxylase was also elevated in the hypothalamus in SHR. From 3 to 8 weeks of age there appeared to be a significant correlation between hypothalamic dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity and blood pressure in the hypertensive rats. In contrast, the activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase were slightly decreased in the DOCA-salt and renal hypertensive rats.

The rate depends on [H+] at moderate pH and becomes independent of [H+] at low pH. This behavior is attributed to substrate protonation at the carbonyl group (pK of NADH = 0.6). The reaction is general acid catalyzed; large solvent deuterium isotope effects are observed for the general acid and lyonium ion terms. Most buffers cause a linear rate increase with increasing buffer concentration, but certain buffers cause a hyperbolic rate increase. The nonlinear buffer effects are due to complexation of the buffer with the substrate, rather than to a change in rate-limiting step. The rate-limiting step is a proton transfer from the general acid species to the C5 position of the substrate.

The slices were incubated at 37 degrees C in enriched Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium gassed with a 95% O2-5% CO2 mixture, in the presence and in the absence of ouabain, Ca++, substrates and specific antagonists. The results indicate that: 1) slices from the treated animals had a similar extent of basal (unstimulated) net K+ release but a significantly higher extent of stimulated net K+ release than control slices; 2) in the presence of ouabain, slices from control and treated animals had similar extents of K+ efflux during basal and stimulated conditions; 3) removal of glucose from the medium resulted in an increased net K+ release from both types of slices, but removal of both glucose and the purines further increased net K+ release from control slices but not from those of treated animals; 4) blockade of receptors 2 minutes after stimulation resulted in a slower rate of K+ reuptake in the slices from treated animals when alpha receptors were blocked with phenolamine but not when cholinergic receptors were blocked with atropine; 5) removal of Ca++ from the medium inhibited the response to norepinephrine and to carbachol, but subsequent addition of Ca++ resulted in a higher extent of net K+ release form the slices of treated animals after norepinephrine, but not carbachol stimulation; 6) there was a 2.57-fold shift to the left and a 3.47-fold shift to the left in the dose-response curve to norepinephrine and carbachol, respectively, after pretreatment with reserpine.

The order of potency of the thyroid compounds in their in vitro erythropoietic effect parallels their known calorigenic potency in vivo, suggesting that the in vitro effect is physiologically relevant. A series of studies linked the mechanism of thyroid action to adrenergic receptors on responsive cells. Propranolol, a global beta-blocker, inhibited thyroid hormone-responsive erythroid colonies. When adrenergic antagonists having different blocking characteristics were added to culture, the thyroid hormone effect was blocked by those compounds having beta(2)-subspecificity. Velocity sedimentation analysis showed that the peak of colony-forming cells which respond to thyroid hormone and the adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, sedimented at an identical rate (7.54 mm/h), which is slower than the major peak of colony-forming cells responding to erythropoietin alone (8.62 mm/h).

Plasma Na concentration was altered by varying the Na concentration of the infused saline from 0.154 to 0.077, 0.616 or 1.232 M.2. Blood pressure (B.P.), packed cell volume (PCV), concentration of plasma solids (PS) and the plasma concentration of H(+) and K (P(K)) ions were measured but no attempt was made to contain their fluctuation.3. An infusion of hypertonic saline into a renal artery usually led to an ipsilateral increase in RBF for 5-15 min, followed by a progressive fall. Over-all, mean values of RBF fell with P(Na) throughout the range studied (120-190 m-mole l.(-1)). Glomerular filtration rate rose with P(Na) to reach maximal values at P(Na) levels of 140-160 m-mole l.(-1), but fell thereafter. The combined fall in RBF and GFR, without change in filtration fraction, at P(Na) values above 160 m-mole l.(-1) is consistent with an alteration in afferent arteriolar resistance. The fall in GFR despite a rise in RBF noted when P(Na) was reduced below 140 m-mole l.(-1) requires an additional explanation.4. Renal blood flow was independent of P(K); it was inversely related to [H(+)] and directly related to PS. Glomerular filtration rate was independent of PCV and P(K). It was also inversely related to [H(+)] and directly related to PS up to a value of 6 g 100 g(-1) plasma, after which the relationship was reversed.

Occupancy of the beta-adrenergic receptors with the [(3)H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol agonist prior to their solubilization from the membrane leads to an increase in apparent receptor size.

The precise molecular interactions responsible for the agonist-induced increase in apparent beta-adrenergic receptor size are still unresolved.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and acetylglutamate are required for the synthesis of CO2-P, which is highly unstable in aqueous solutions (t1/2 = 0.75 s at 24 degrees C at neutral pH). In the absence of ammonia, CO2-P attains rapidly a steady-state level, which depends on the concentration of ATP and HCO3-. The \"apparent KM'S\" are approximately equal to those found for the adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) activity of the enzyme. The maximum level of CO2-P is limited by the amount of enzyme, and approximates 4 mol of intermediate/mol of enzyme. The unprotonated form of ammonia seems to be the species reacting with CO2-P to produce CP. The reaction of CO2-P and NH3 is very fast (rate constant kn = 8 x 10(4) M-1 S-1) and does not consume free ATP. Therefore, the 2 mol of ATP necessary for CP synthesis binds or reacts with the enzyme and/or CO2 prior to reaction with NH3. The reaction of CO2-P with NH3 also takes place in acetone under conditions at which the enzyme is not active, suggesting little or no assistance from enzyme catalysis or that a part of the catalytic site is \"frozen\" by the solvent in the active conformation. In the light of these and other findings, a new scheme is proposed for the mechanism of frog liver carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase and some considerations are made on the chemical nature of the intermediate and on the possible evolutionary significance of the reaction of CO2-P with NH3 in acetone.", "pmid": "13811", "mesh_set": "D000096 D000227 D000641 D000818 D001001 D001639 D002222 D002221 D002245 D055598 D002621 D005971 D006863 D007700 D008274 D008930 D008954 D010710 D010770 D011892", "score": 15.740135, "rank": 4203, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In non-injured rats the 6-OHDA treatment did not affect the threshold environmental temperature (Ta) for the onset of shivering or the slope of the regression lines relating intensity of shivering to Ta. It raised the core temperature (Tc) threshold for the opening of the A-V anastomoses in the tail. Whereas in normal rats ischaemic limb injury depresses the threshold Ta for the onset of shivering without altering the slope of the regression line, in 6-OHDA-treated rats no depression of the threshold Ta was observed during limb ischaemia but the slope of the regression line was lower. The Tc threshold for the opening of the A-V anastomoses in the tail was the same as in the 6-OHDA-treated controls. The injection of NA into a lateral cerebral ventricle of a normal rat in a 5 degrees environment inhibited shivering and lowered Tc. The 6-OHDA treatment did not induce hypersensitivity to the injection of NA by this route. It is thought that NA is concerned in the central inhibition of shivering during limb ischaemia.", "pmid": "836766", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001833 D002552 D006614 D006892 D008297 D009638 D051381 D012768 D013696 D014947", "score": 26.831337, "rank": 769, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Acylcoenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity was 30-100% higher in microsomes prepared from the cells grown on coconut oil (M(c)) than in those prepared from the cells grown on sunflower oil (M(s)). Increased ACAT activity was noted in M(c) with either [1-(14)C]palmitoyl CoA or [1,2-(3)H]cholesterol as the labeled substrate. This occurred at all acyl CoA concentrations tested and, in the [1,2-(3)H]cholesterol assay, with palmitoyl, oleoyl, or linoleoyl CoA as the substrate. The pH optimum for ACAT activity was the same with M(c) and M(s), pH 7.0. ACAT activity obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics at palmitoyl CoA concentrations between 1 and 10 micro M. Substrate inhibition occurred at higher concentrations. Kinetic analysis with [1-(14)C]palmitoyl CoA as the substrate indicated that the apparent K(m) for M(c) was 33% smaller than for M(s). There was no difference, however, in apparent V(max) values. The cholesterol and phospholipid contents of M(c) and M(s) were similar, but their fatty acid compositions differed considerably. M(c) contained 2.7 times more monoenoic fatty acid and only half as much polyenoic fatty acid as M(s). Our results indicate that dietary modification of the microsomal fatty acid composition is associated with alterations in the activity of ACAT, an enzyme that is tightly bound to the microsomes.

Condensation of these analogues with N-trifluoroacetyl-glycine or beta-alanine in the presence of a water-soluble carbodiimide generated several 8-substituted derivatives. These analogues: (see article) comprised an 8-substituted Ado-5'-P ligand to which a spacer molecule of similar length but differing hydrophobicity was attached. The derivatives were purified, characterised and attached to CNBr-activated Sepharose. The chromatographic behaviour of the resulting absorbents was investigated in terms of their ability to bind both lactate and alanine dehydrogenase. The enzymes bound tighter to the more hydrophobic derivatives with the strength of the interaction decreasing with increasing hydropholicity. The effect of the introduction of a single hydroxyl group in the spacer arm was also studied with several enzymes known to exhibit anomalous behavior on affinity chromatography. In free solution, (Ado-5'-P)-8-NH CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2 and (Ado-5'-P)-8-NH CH2-CH CH2NH CO CH2NH2 were competitive with NADH for rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, (see article) with Ki values of 2.0 and 1.8 mM respectively. These data suggest a difference in accessibility of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic derivatives when attached to Sepharose rather than a fundamental difference in affinity. This suggestion is supported by the fact that there is no obvious correlation between the Ki values in free solution of a series of 8-(omega-aminoalkyl)-Ado-5'-P derivatives of increasing chain length, and hence hydrophobicity, and their chromatographic behaviour when immobilised. The data suggest that the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the spacer arm determined the accessibility of the immobilised ligand to interaction with the complementary enzyme.", "pmid": "837941", "mesh_set": "D000249 D000818 D002846 D004798 D007700 D007770 D009132 D011817 D013056 D013329", "score": 16.211987, "rank": 3987, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Fundamental differences in the action of estrogens and antiestrogens on the uterus: comparison between compounds with similar duration of action.", "abstract": "In order to understand differences in the mechanism of action of estrogens and antiestrogens, it is essential to make comparisons between compounds with similar duration of action. Hence, in these studies, we compare the action of a long-acting estrogen (17alpha-ethinyl estriol-3-cyclopentyl ether, EE3CPE) and a long-acting antiestrogen (U-11,100AUA) on the immature rat uterus and analyze different dosage regimens (single and multiple injections) in studying the effects of these compounds on the uterine estrogen receptor and on uterine growth and sensitivity to estradiol. During the first 24 h, UA (50 microng) and EE3CPE (5 microng) evoke remarkably similar receptor distribution patterns and uterine wet weight increase; however, pronounced differences are seen with long-term, multiple injection regimens (every 12 or 24 h for 72 h). Such treatment with UA results in maintenance of high nuclear receptor levels and very low cytoplasmic receptor levels (ca. 10% of total), but no further increase in uterine weight, DNA or protein content, or total receptor content beyond 24-48 h. In contrast, multiple injections of EE3CPE produce not only a prolonged nuclear retention of receptor, but a progressive increase in total receptor content in the tissue and 35-50% of total receptor is cytoplasmic; uterine weight and DNA and protein content also continue to increase markedly above the 24 h level, and responsiveness to estradiol is maintained. However, regardless of whether the uterus continues to grow (as the EE3CPE) or stops growing after 24-48 h (as with UA), the receptor content on a cell basis is similar. Hence, uterine responsiveness to estradiol and continued uterine growth appear not to be related to the total content of receptor per cell, but rather are correlated with the cytoplasmic receptor level within the cell. As there is a continuous translocation of cytoplasmic receptor to the necleus in the growing uterus, the antagonistic action of antiestrogens appears to derive from their ability to effect a marked perturbation in the subcellular distribution of receptor, whereby very little of receptor (ca. 10%) is cytoplasmic, and further estrogen receptor accumulation (most likely synthesis) is blocked.", "pmid": "849722", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004247 D004958 D005260 D009256 D009651 D009929 D011506 D011759 D011800 D051381 D011960 D013997 D014599", "score": 14.428305, "rank": 4888, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Radioactivity was selectively localized in the liver where it was present mainly as metabolites of AMSA. After 2 hr, nearly 50% of the plasma radioactivity was bound to protein and did not dissociate upon Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Radioactivity was rapidly eliminated in the bile; greater than 50% of the administered dose was excreted by this route in 2 hr. Bile/plasma ratios of greater than 400:1 indicated an active transport mechanism. The biliary transport mechanism was saturable with therapeutic doses. AMSA was found to be especially vulnerable to nucleophilic attack by alkylthiols resulting in displacement of 4-amino-3-methoxymethanesulfonanilide and the formation of the corresponding 9-alkylthioether of acridine. The major radioactive biliary metabolite (accounting for 90-95% of the biliary radioactivity) possessed the same chromatographic properties as the thiolysis product of AMSA and glutathione (GSH). A 40% reduction in liver GSH and a 20% reduction of liver GSH-transferase activity occurred after AMSA administration to mice. The pharmacologic disposition of AMSA can best be explained by a nonenzymatic nucleophilic attack on the 9-carbon atom of AMSA by endogenous thiols, resulting in the formation of 9-thioethers of acridine.

The optimum pH was between 7.0-7.5 for the mitochondrial fraction and between 6.5-8.0 for the cytosol fraction. Radio gas chromatography showed that palmitic acid was the most highly labeled acid, followed by stearic acid, in the mitochondrial fraction in accord with the pathway of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Some of the labeled acetate was also incorporated into the 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acids of this fraction. Distribution of radioactivity among the mitochondrial lipid classes was highest in the phospholipids and monoglycerides, followed by diglycerides and cholesterol; little radioactivity was present in the triglyceride fraction. These observations are in accord with studies of the incorporation of labeled metabolites into testicular lipids following intratesticular injection and indicate the validity of the in vitro system for studies of specific reactions occurring in vivo.", "pmid": "1622", "mesh_set": "D000085 D000255 D000818 D003065 D003600 D005227 D006863 D008055 D008274 D008297 D008928 D009249 D051381 D013737", "score": 24.977043, "rank": 1024, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Thermal denaturation and regeneration of japanese-radish peroxidase.", "abstract": "Thermal denaturation of Japanese-radish peroxidase [EC 1.11.1.7] was investigated with respect to its spectrophotometric properties and effect on the enzymatic activity. Inactivation of the peroxidase occurred at temperatures higher than 60degrees and involved three processes, i.e., dissociation of protohemin from the holoperoxidase, a conformation change in the apperoxidase, and the modification or degradation of protohemin. The splitting process of protohemin from holoperoxidase as followed by the change in the absorption spectrum at high temperatures coincided with the degrease in the activity, and it was found to be at least biphasic. The regeneration of peroxidase on cooling to room temperature was essentially reversible at neutral pH, while at pH 5 and pH 9 these processes were irreversible. The irreversibility at acidic pH was mainly due to an irreversible change in the conformation of the apoenzyme. The difference spectrum of heat-treated apoperoxidase exhibited a denaturation blueshift with negative maxima at 287 and 294 nm, and the total protein fluorescence quantum yield. qprotein, increased by 20% compared to that of the untreated apoenzyme. On the other hand, the irreversibility at alkaline pH was largely attributable to the modification of protohemin. Apoperoxidase was more resistnat to heat denaturation but the modification or degradation of protohemin in heated enzyme was greater at alkaline pH than at acidic pH. The pyridine-ferrohemochrome spectrum of peroxidase exhibited slight shifts of the maxima of the alpha-band to shorter wavelength on heat treatment, and the paper chromatogram showed the presence of a new derivative other than protohemin. The modified product is probably (2(4)-vinyl-4(2)-hydroxyethyldeuterohemin.", "pmid": "5412", "mesh_set": "D004355 D006427 D006735 D006358 D006863 D007700 D046911 D010544 D011485 D011487 D011489 D013053 D013056", "score": 11.970217, "rank": 5767, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

An almost linear increase in total motor activity was observed from 1 to 15 days of age followed by a pronounced decrease in motor activity between days 15 and 18. The in vivo rate of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in whole brain was estimated by means of measuring accumulation of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) after administration of an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase NSD 1015. Additionally, Dopa accumulation was studied in regional brain areas in 10 and 14-day-old animals. A slight gradual increase in the amount of Dopa accumulation in whole brain was observed from 1 to 10 days of age, followed by a pronounced increase between 10 and 14 days. Regional studies revealed that the increase in Dopa accumulation was primarily located to striatum. The data suggest an involvement of central catecholamine neurons possibly dopaminergic, terminating in striatum.

The overall objective of this study was to examine group housing management system for sows during gestation as an alternative for individual confinement stalls, and the possible effects on their welfare, production and reproduction performances. Accordingly, the study included three specific objectives: (1) to compare parameters of production, reproduction, and welfare of sows housed in groups (either 30 or 7 sows/group; Large Group: LG, Small Group: SG, respectively) during gestation as compared to individual confinement stalls (IS); (2) to compare saliva cortisol of pregnant sows throughout gestation, when housed in groups of three different sizes (either 7, 15 or 30 sows per pen group); and (3) to compare sows' production and reproduction performances at the herd level, before, during and after practically transforming from a management of individual confinement stalls to a group housing system, in a large commercial swine farm over a six-year period. Mean cycle length (weaning-to-weaning) was shorter in group housing management as compared to individual stalls (P\u2009=\u20090.0110), but gestation length did not differ among the three groups. Overall farrowing rate (sows farrowed out of those inseminated) was higher (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.0134) for sows housed in groups (either SG or LG). Furthermore, there was a tendency towards a higher number of total born (P\u2009=\u20090.1033), and born alive piglets (P\u2009=\u20090.0862), in group housing system as compared to individual housing management; however, it did not differ between the LG and SG groups. Injuries and lameness index (ILI) of sows improved significantly over the gestation period in group housing management. Group saliva cortisol during gestation did not differ significantly among groups of 7, 15, or 30 sows, except on the first saliva sampling, just after sows were mixed into groups, where cortisol level was significantly higher in sows housed in a pen of 30 sows. Production and reproduction performances at the herd level, over a 6-years period- before, during and after transforming to a group housing system, improved significantly: shortened cycle length, increased farrowing rate, and increased number of total born and born alive piglets. In conclusion, group housing management during gestation was associated with better reproduction, productivity and welfare of sows, as compared to individual stalls. A welfare friendly housing system can be beneficial and effective for both the farmers and the animals.", "pmid": "30388991", "mesh_set": "D000827 D000818 D005260 D006799 D006854 D007794 D011247 D012098 D012463 D013552 D013553", "score": 11.827802, "rank": 5804, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Slight diminution in the MNCV was observed 1 day after 1-2 h ischemia, whereas 3-6 h ischemia resulted in a complete conduction block. Diminution in the NCV occurred first after ischemia for 2 h and a complete block was seen after 4 and 6 h ischemia. Reduced NCV and MNCV were seen between 4 and 18 days only in the animals subjected to ischemia of longer duration of 3-6 h. Both the NCV and MNCV were nearly normalized at the 90th day. Ischemia of 4 and 6 h resulted in denervation of some of the muscle fibers, seen as spontaneous fibrillation at the 4th and 18th day. Electron microscopy and histometric studies showed degeneration of myelinated fibers increasingly after longer durations of ischemia; ischemia for 2 h caused a degeneration of about 5%, 3 h of about 35%, 4 h about 45%, and 6 h about 75% of the fibers. Myelinated fibers of different sizes were equally damaged. In the teased fiber preparations normal and myelin sheaths undergoing Wallerian-like degeneration was seen.

On a fixed ratio 30 (FR 30) schedule of food reinforcement, the neonatal 60HDA treated rats responded at a significantly higher rate. Further analysis of the FR 30 response pattern indicated that the higher rate was due to a decrease in the amount of time spent pausing after the receipt of each reinforcer. The 60HDA treatment failed to alter the rat's behaviour during the extinction of the FR 30 response and on the progressive ratio or variable interval schedules of food reinforcement.

The tyrosine hydroxylase activity in these same brain areas was not significantly altered, but there appeared to be some decrease in the activity of this enzyme in the hippocampus.

Plasma prolactin titers in intact controls remained uniformly low from Day 20 to Day 70, contrasting with previous reports in which increasing prolactin levels have been observed during sexual development. To determine the reason for this apparent discrepancy, a longitudinal experiment was conducted in which intact and cryptorchid male rats were bled every 10 days from Day 30 to Day 70, following a 3-min period of exposure to ether fumes.

A similar pattern of prolactin was observed in a cross-sectional study in which different groups of intact animals were bled following a 3-min period of ether exposure, at ages ranging from 20 to 70 daysmthe results indicate that unlike FSH secretion, prolactin secretion is not controlled by the seminiferous tubules.

(2) When bile duct-cannulated rats were given retrorsine (40 mg/kg) and the bile collected at 1 h intervals, the relative concentration of pyrrolic metabolites was greatest in the first 1 h sample and was negligibly small by 7 h after dosing. By 7 h, about 25% of the dose had been excreted as pyrrolic metabolites. (3) In rats given [3H]synthanecine A bis-N-ethylcarbamate (40 mg/kg), the amounts of radioactivity and the relative levels of pyrrolic metabolites in the bile were greatest in the first 0.5 h sample and became negligibly small by 4 h after dosing.

After preincubation with an effector (ATP, NADPH, or Pi) the activity of forms a and c was unaffected, whereas the activity of b, the regulatory form, was increased 10-fold. Activation was accompanied by the exposure of previously hidden sulfhydryl groups. The rate of activation was slower than the rate of catalysis and resulted in a lag phase during the measurement of activity when the enzyme was preincubated in the absence of an effector. The addition of one of several compounds as a second effector (at a concentration which itself was nonactivating) in the presence of a first effector enhanced activation by lowering the concentration of the first effector required for half-maximal activation (Pi constant/ATP or NADPH varied; ATP or NADPH constant/Pi varied). Other combinations of effectors caused little change in activity (ATP constant/NADPH varied; NADPH constant/ATP varied). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate added as a second effector induced contrasting changes: an increase in the ATP-mediated activation and a decrease in the NADPH-mediated activation.

Control L(6) myotubes have a low and uniform distribution of acetylcholine receptors (20 +/- 3 sites per mum(2) in the present study). The addition of spinal cord explants caused an increase in average receptor site density of about 6 times on myotubes within 2 mm of the explant, while a smaller increase of 3 times was observed at distances greater than 5 mm. The formation of high-density patches of receptors was also stimulated. These observations suggested that a diffusible substance originating from the explant was responsible for these changes. Cell-free homogenates of the central nervous system were prepared and found to produce the same effects. The effect of the homogenate was not strongly dependent on the age of the fetus from which the tissue was isolated, and fetal liver had little or no effect. The active component(s) appears to be a protein(s) with a molecular weight of about 100,000.

The accumulation of Dopa in the rat striatum after administration of Dopa decarboxylase inhibitor was used as an index of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity. It was found that administration of the dopamine agonists, apomorphine or ET-495 [1-(2-pyrimidyl)-piperonyl-piperazine], modified the apparent activity of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase when impulse flow was blocked in dopamine neurons. This presynaptic effect of apomorphine could be prevented by low doses of loxapine haloperidol and spiroperidol. Chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, and thioridizine were much less effective than the butyrophenones in blocking the effects of apomorphine.

The present study has used OCE rats to evaluate the role of insulin in the altered fat metabolism of the fasted rats in late pregnancy. The adipose tissue of 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats was enriched to more than 25% undecanoate (c11:0) and higher OCFA by feeding them a complete diet high in triundecanoin content for six weeks. Twenty-four female controls were fed a similar diet except that the fat was exclusively corn oil. Both OCE and control rats were than mated and on day 18 of pregnancy were divided into four groups: one group was killed fed, one after a 24 h fast, and one after a 48 h fast; the fourth group was fed to day 20 of pregnancy and then killed.

{"title": "Adaptive responses of brain cyclic AMP-generating systems to alterations in synaptic input.", "abstract": "The concept of subsensitivity and supersensitivity as a mechanism of neuronal adaptation to alterations in synaptic activity in the brain is an attractive one. However, the complexity of the central nervous system has made it difficult to determine the cellular basis of apparent changes in neuronal excitability resulting from alterations in synaptic input (cf. ref. 83). It now seems that, at least for inhibitory central pathways in which cyclic AMP-generating systems mediate postsynaptic receptor-responses, alterations in synaptic input lead in rat cortex to predictable super- or subsensitivity of the norepinephrine-sensitive cyclic AMP-systems. Supersensitivity of histamine-sensitive cyclic AMP-systems also occurs in rat cortex as a result of apparent lesions of histaminergic tracts. The reason that supersensitivity does not develop to norepinephrine and histamine in guinea pig cortex after similar \"denervations\" is not known, but is central to an understanding of the factors involved in the role of cyclic AMP-mechanisms to the adaptive plasticity of the central nervous system. However, even before an understanding of all the factors involved in alterations in cyclic AMP-responses in brain tissue is obtained, studies on the effects of environmental and drug-manipulations can provide insights both into the central roles for cyclic AMP-mechanisms and into the nature of drug action.

All faecal incubation systems studied generated large amounts of ammonia, particularly those in which bacterial counts fell during incubation. As normal faeces contain negligible amounts of urea this ammonia must have been generated from sources other than urea. 3. Ammonia was also generated by faeces delivered by sodium chloride enema, and by ileostomy fluid, indicating that the phenomenon is not confined to distal colonic contents. 4. Ammonia generation by incubated faeces was inhibited by prior autoclaving of the sample, but not by sterilization with gamma-irradiation. 5. Generation of ammonia by incubated stool was accompanied by release of large amounts of organic anion and a fall in pH. 6. These observations are interpreted as evidence that ammonia generated within the colon in situ is not derived exclusively from urea, but also from bacterial deamination of amino acids, peptides and proteins. Simultaneously bacterial activity generates large amounts of organacid. The presence of living bacteria is not essential for ammonia generation, provided that bacterial enzymes are present. 7.

Reciprocal regulation of yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylase by fructose bisphosphate and citrate.", "abstract": "The abnormal accumulation of lipids due to myo-inositol deficiency in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, and the mechanism involved was investigated. The deficient cells contained much more neutral lipids with a greater ratio of unsaturated fatty acids compared to the supplemented cells, whereas there was no significant change in their phospholipid contents. The biosynthesis of fatty acids and sterols from acetate, and of triacylglycerols and sterol esters from palmitate was markedly augmented in the deficient cells. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity of the deficient supernatant was 2- to 5-fold higher than that of the supplemented. However, the activity from both sources was not significantly different after Sephadex G-25 gel filtration of the supernatant, suggesting the presence of low molecular effector(s) in the deficient supernatant. There was a great increase in acid-soluble glycogen, trehalose, and fructose-1,6-P2, as well as a drastic decrease in citrate in the deficient cells. Their intracellular levels were calculated so that their effects on acetyl-CoA carboxylase was examined over the range of physiological concentration. Citrate strongly inhibited the enzyme activity of the supernatant, but it had no effect on the preparation after gel filtration. On the other hand, fructose-1,6-P2 stimulated the enzyme activity both before and after gel filtration. The acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in the gel filtrate was measured as a function of citrate concentration at several fixed concentrations of fructose-1,6-P2. Citrate counteracted the activation by fructose-1,6-P2 in a dose-dependent manner. Citrate lacked the inhibitory effect in the absence of fructose-1,6-P2. It was concluded from these results that neutral lipid accumulation in the deficient cells reflected an increase in the synthesis of fatty acids, at least partly based on an enhancement of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, and that the operation of a reciprocal regulation of the enzyme by fructose-1,6-P2 and citrate caused a marked elevation of the enzyme activity in the deficient cells with a high fructose-1,6-P2 level and a low citrate level.", "pmid": "9400", "mesh_set": "D000103 D002455 D002951 D005227 D005636 D006598 D007294 D007700 D008025 D050356 D010743 D012440 D012441 D013261 D013347 D013997 D014280", "score": 22.919073, "rank": 1403, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Induction of senescence in wild type by dietary amino acid analogs and reversal by antioxidants and membrane stabilizers.", "abstract": "The extensional growth rate of wild-type 74A8 N. crassa in the presence of various concentrations of 19 amino acid analogs was measured. Seven analogs were not inhibitory at concentrations in the range of one to 10mM. Of the remaining 12 analogs, nine inhibited growth in a novel way. The kinetics of growth in the presence of these analogs at 30 degrees were characterized by seven sequential phases: (1)lag; (2) acceleration of growth rate; (3) steady-state growth rate; (4) exponential rate of decline of growth rate; (5) no growth or growth rate less than or equal to 0.1 mm h-1; (6) accleration of growth rate; and (7) steady state. At 33 degrees, phases 6 and 7 did not occur and irreparable death of the clones occurred. The mechanism by which the clones acquired resistance at 30 degrees appeared to involve a combination of physiological adaptation and cellular selection. Dietary application of either free radical scavengers or surface-active membrane 'stabilizers' alleviated or prevented the inhibition and deterioration of growth rate which occurred in the presence of the nine amino acid analogs. Culture with either 4-fluorophenylalanine or ethionine led to an increase of the activities of antioxygenic enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase. The amino acid analogs that cause senescence and death of growing cells are known to be incorporated into proteins and such proteins are generally abnormal. Because a substantial fraction of cellular protein occurs in membranes and the proteins synthesized by mitochondria are exclusively intrinsic membrane proteins, we suggest that  a primary consequence of errors in protein synthesis is the production of faulty membranes. The deterioration of such membranes with associated lipid autoxidation and free radical production proceeding as a chain reaction at an exponential rate may in itself contribute to the exponential rate of cellular deterioration which is characteristic of the ageing process.

This effect can be inhibited by the addition of large amounts of calcium chloride to the culture medium. The increased rate of budding is preceded by a dramatic increase in the number of nerve cells per animal, which is first observed within six hours after lead treatment. This appears to be the result of an increased rate of mitosis in the undifferentiated interstitial cells and their subsequent differentiation into nerve cells.

{"title": "Inhibition and alternate-substrate studies on the mechanism of malic enzyme.", "abstract": "A number of dead-end inhibitors and alternate substrates were examined to gain an understanding of the substrate specificity and mechanism of malic enzyme. Comparison of Ki values for competitive inhibitors suggested that binding of the l-carboxyl of L-malate is by ion pairing with lysine or arginine, while binding of the 4-carboxyl is weaker, and probably of the induced-dipolar type. The 2-hydroxyl hydrogen bonds to a catalytic group, which, when it is protonated, adsorbs the keto form of oxalacetate. Since the only molecule other than L-malate that is oxidized is L-malate-beta-amide, carbon 4 must be trigonal for substrate activity, although a tetrahedral carbon bearing one or two hydroxyl groups gives good binding. Hydroxy groups at carbon 3 contribute to binding, but prevent substrate activity. Hydroxy and ketomalonates are bound more strongly than any of the four carbon acids, suggesting that the latter are bound with some strain. In inhibition studies, pyruvate analogues were competitive vs. pyruvate but noncompetitive vs. malate, while malate analogues were competitive vs. malate and noncompetitive vs. pyruvate. These compounds thus bind to both enzyme-triphosphopyridine nucleotide (E-TPN) and enzyme-reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide (E-TPNH), but only malate analogues prevent release of TPN, while pyruvate analogues prevent release of TPNH. Ketomalonate and oxalacetate, both of which are slowly reduced by the enzyme in the presence of TPNH and thus must combine in the keto form with E-TPNH,, appear to combine with E-TPN mainly in the gem-diol (or for oxalacetate, also the enol) form.

A small effect was apparent by 3 days, and stimulation increased as donor rats aged (up to 4--5 wk). One-day diaphragms also had greater uptake than older tissues, due to both decreased Km and elevated Vmax. The change in insulin sensitivity did not result from alteration in the transport system used by alpha-aminoisobutyrate because uptake showed characteristics of the A system at both 1 day and older. Results suggest instead that the 1-day tissues had been made insulin-resistant by high insulin levels in donor animals. Plasma insulin levels of 1-day-old rats were 5 times those of 5-day animals. Elevating the plasma insulin levels of 5-day or 25- to 35-day rats led to a decreased effectiveness of insulin in vitro in stimulating alpha-aminoisobutyrate transport into their diaphragms.

A method for the estimation of N-ethoxyformyl (EF)-His at pH 5--7 and of O-ethoxyformyl (EF)-Tyr in alkaline solution by measuring A 242 nm (ximM = 3.2) and A278 nm (ximM = 1.16), respectively, was developed. The formation of EF-His and EF-Tyr was an electrophilic reaction and was dependent on pH, exhibiting pK values of 6.8 and 9.9, respectively. The maximal yield of EF-His at pH 6.0 was 49% of the total histidine content, but no inactivation nor unfolding of the enzyme was observed. The formation of 12 EF-Tyr residues per mole of catalase at pH 8.1 did not cause any inactivation, but the formation of 8 more EF-Tyr residues at pH 8.9 resulted in both inactivation and unfolding. Nearly complete inactivation and partial splitting of catalase were observed when 43-46 EF-Tyr residues per mole were produced at pH 10.0. More EF-His residues were formed by the reaction of diethyl pyrocarbonate with cyanoethylated (CE)-catalase monomer (subunit) than with CE-catalase tetramer. The CE-catalase tetramer and monomer were extensively O-ethoxyformylated, reaching 100% EF-Tyr formation. These results indicate that a half of the histidine residues may lie outside the protein core and that three-quarters of the tyrosine residues are probably in the protein core of the enzyme.

{"title": "pH-dependent effects of Cr(NH3)2ATP on kinetics of yeast hexokinase PII. Relationship to the slow transition mechanism.", "abstract": "The effect of Cr(NH3)2ATP, a virtually inert, inner sphere metal-ligand complex, on the kinetics of purified yeast hexokinase PII has been studied at pH 6.5 and pH 7.5. At pH 6.5, where the normal assays exhibit a slow burst-type transient, low concentrations of Cr(NH3)2ATP were found to activate both phii, the initial velocity, and phiII, the steady state velocity. At higher concentrations, Cr(NH3)2ATP was found to be a competitive inhibitor versus MgATP for both phii and phiII. The apparent Ki values for both velocities were the same. The inhibition by Cr(NH3)2ATP at pH 6.5 was found to be a slow process with half-times similar to those found for the normal burst-type transient at this pH value. At pH 7.5, where normal assays exhibit linear progress curves, Cr(NH3)2ATP behaved similarly to that observed before at pH 7 (Danenberg, D. D., and Cleland, W. W. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 28-39), i.e. it was a competitive inhibitor versus MgATP and it caused a slowing of the reaction rate over the first several minutes. The apparent Ki for the initial velocity was 8-fold higher than the apparent Ki for the steady state velocity, suggesting tighter binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time. Preincubation experiments indicated that the normal pH 6.5 burst-type transient could be eliminated by appropriate preincubation with Cr(NH3)2ATP and a sugar. In agreement with Danenberg and Cleland (1975), similar preincubations have been shown to produce linear assays at pH 7.5 in the presence of Cr(NH3)2ATP. Similar results were seen with MgITP as the nucleotide substrate, where a burst-type transient is not seen at either pH value under normal assay conditions. At pH 7.5, a slow decrease in the reaction rate is seen over the first several minutes in the presence of Cr(NH3)2ATP. The apparent Ki for phii was 7-fold higher than the apparent Ki value for phiII, again suggesting a tighter binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time. A similar observation was made at pH 6.5, but the Ki values for phii and phiII were the same, suggesting no tightening of the binding of Cr(NH3)2ATP with time at this pH value. These results suggested that both slow processes reflect the same basic molecular change, but the consequences are different at the two pH values, presumably because of the difference in the charge of the enzyme. The Cr(NH3)2ATP kinetics at pH 6.5 have been interpreted in terms of a modification of the slow transition mechanism for hexokinase (Shill, J. P., and Neet, K. E. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2259-2268). It is postulated that glucose and Cr(NH3)2ATP induce the same slow conformational change at pH 6.5 as that induced by glucose and MgATP, which gives rise to the normal burst-type transient. This suggests that Cr(NH3)2ATP may be a useful tool for physical studies to determine the cause of the slow transition of yeast hexokinase. Activation by low concentrations of Cr(NH3)2ATP was interpreted as binding of the nucleotide to an activator site on the enzyme, causing a shift in the distribution of enzyme towards the more active form.", "pmid": "12169", "mesh_set": "D000255 D002857 D006593 D006863 D007292 D007527 D007700 D008274 D000644 D012441 D013997", "score": 10.229327, "rank": 6039, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

It was found that with age the pH value of blood decreases, the tension of the carbonic acid increases, but the values of BB, BE, SB, and AB do not undergo any significant changes. With loads, old animals showed more profound changes in the system and these changes were of decompensated character. The maximal changes in young animals were registered 1.5 hours after loading, in old rats--3 hours after. The normalization of the shifts in old rats occurred much more slowly than in young animals, and it does not reached the initial value by 24 hours after loading. The analysis of the data obtained shows that with aging the reserve potentialities of the organism's mechanisms of the acid-base balance regulation greatly decrease, which under certain conditions results in disturbance of the given system compensation, thus exerting a negative effect on the body vital processes.", "pmid": "3873", "mesh_set": "D000136 D000375 D000818 D001769 D002245 D006863 D051381", "score": 18.202225, "rank": 2971, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

An enzyme fraction required for binding of methionyl-tRNAf to 40 S subunits and peptide initiation, tentatively equated with eIF-(4 + 5), has GTPase activity and appears to be responsible for hydrolysis of GTP in the methionyl-tRNAf.eIF-2.GTP complex. Direct analysis of the methionyl-tRNAf.40 S complex formed with with eIF-2 and [8-3H] guanine, [gamma-32P]GTP reveals bound guanine but not gamma-phosphate. Edeine, a peptide antibiotic containing spermidine and beta-tyrosine residues at its COOH terminus and NH2 terminus, respectively, blocks peptide initiation and interferes with binding of methionyl-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits. Inhibition of binding is observed when the eIF-2-mediated binding reaction is carried out with GTP but not with guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate or guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate. Edeine was labeled by iodination and shown to bind with high affinity to 40 S but not to 60 S ribosomal subunits.

Binding to the nuclear fraction decreased sigificantly by 2 weeks after incorporation of (3H) leucine into pineal proteins in Gx. A single injection of E2 (mug) to testosterone propionate (TP) (500 mug) failed to increase the Gx rats when injected 1 or 5 days after surgery.

The administration of isoproterenol 19 and 3 h before sacrifice replenished pineal-binding sites for E2 and testosterone in Gx rats, but failed to restore the responsiveness of denervated pineals to hormone administration. Moreover, E2 or TP treatment blocked the increase in labeled amino acid incorporation into proteins brought about by isoproterenol per se. The administration of propranolol 2 and 7 h after hormone injection decreased the ability of E2 and TP to enhance [3H]leucine incorporation by 55 and 41%, respectively.

Intravenously, tryptamine in doses of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg increased electrogenesis, whereas 1 mg/kg initially decreased and subsequently increased electrogenesis.

Neither atropine nor reserpine pretreatment prevented this decrease, whereas chlorpromazine and methysergide abolished it. Intravenous infusions of tryptamine at 1 mg/kg/min caused a nonsignificant increase in electrogenesis but 2 and 4 mg/kg/min infusions caused a sustained decrease. These results show that tryptamine has a biphasic effect on the cortical EEG: low doses enhance synchrony while high doses alert the EEG.

However, the present study demonstrates that a single injection of a large dose of EB (50 microng) two days after septal destruction did not modify subsequent responsiveness to EB priming in male rats relative to sham operated controls. Yet male rats given 10 daily injections of 5.0 microng EB/day immediately following a septal lesion were more responsive to EB than oil treated controls when tested later for lordosis behavior. Therefore, the capacity for EB to alter the behavioral effects of septal lesions on lordosis behavior in male rats is related to both chronic administration and a period of susceptibility to some action of EB during the immediate post-lesion period. In two additional experiments, chronic hypothyroidism induced by propylthiouracil or thyroidectomy was also found to modify the effects of septal lesions on female sexual behavior of male rats.

In young (40 g) rats killed five to ten minutes after the injection, radioautographs of distal tubule cells show that the Golgi apparatus contained about 85% of the cell label. By 30 hours, only 8% of the label remained in this organnele, whereas 67% was in the plasma membrane, indicating that most of the label had migrated from Golgi apparatus to this membrane. Similarly, in proximal tubule cells, about 82% of the label was initially in the Golgi apparatus, but less than 2% remained at 30 hours, at which time 78% was in the plasma membrane. In the latter cells, the apical tubules and vacuoles became heavily labeled before the apical microvilli did and, therefore, may be involved in the transit of label from the Golgi apparatus to the microvillous membrane. The results are interpreted to mean that, in kidney tubule cells, the Golgi apparatus is the site of a continuous incorporation of fucose into glycoproteins and that these migrate to the plasma membrane. In fully formed cells, such a conclusion would imply a continuous turnover of plasma membrane glycoproteins. However, in the rapidly growing kidney of young rats many new cells are added daily, the growth of which might involve net addition as well as turnover of glycoproteins. Accordingly, the experiment has been repeated in adult mice, in which the cells are assumed to be fully formed. Furthermore, since turnover implies eventual decrease of incorporated label, some of the animals have been killed at longer intervals, up to 27 days after injection. In these adult mice, as in young rats, prompt Golgi uptake and subsequent migration of label to the plasma membrane were observed in distal and proximal tubules cells. With time the label content of the plasma membrane decreased gradually, and by 27 days had virtually disappeared. From grain counts, it is concluded that the mean half-life of glycoproteins in the apical membrane of distal tubule cells is about two days, whereas in both the apical and basal membranes of proximal tubule cells, it is slightly over three days.", "pmid": "848452", "mesh_set": "D000367 D000818 D002462 D003593 D004848 D005643 D006023 D006056 D007684 D007686 D007687 D008247 D008565 D051379 D008854 D051381", "score": 17.305079, "rank": 3399, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The same cells produce acid phosphatase immediately on shifting the medium pH to 4.0 or above. Like intact cells, spheroplasts prepared from cells grown at pH 3.0 or 4.5 in medium with a limited amount of inorganic phosphate in suspension begin production of acid phosphatase immediately after pH shift from below 3.0 to 4.0 whereas sheroplasts from cells grown in inorganic phosphate-rich medium showed a prolonged lag period (3 h).

No significant differences could be detected in cellular growth or in incorporation of 3H-L-lysine or 14C-adenine between cells cultivated at pH 3.0 and 4.5. These results along with the fact that the expression of structural genes of repressible acid and alkaline phosphatases is controlled by a common genetic regulatory system, at least in part, indicate that the genetic regulatory system operates to express the structural genes even at low pH, though the expression of repressible acid phosphatase is interrupted. Coupled experiments of temperature and pH shifts with the temperature-sensitive mutants of the regulatory genes suggest that the acidic pH affects the function of the cytoplasmic products of those genes in the expression of the structural gene.

When rats were fed a 64% sucrose diet (19% casein), there was a two- to three-fold increase in synthesis of amylase.

When rats were fed a 19% sucrose diet (64% casein), there was a significant increase in chymotrypsinogen synthesis. Of the poor-quality proteins, gluten was the only one effective in stimulating synthesis of chymotrypsinogen. Peptides, either free or as part of a protein, were necessary for the stimulation of chymotrypsinogen synthesis.

{"title": "Effect of antipsychotic drugs on the firing of dorsal raphe cells. I. Role of adrenergic system.", "abstract": "The activity of serotonergic (5HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus was inhibited by the i.v. administration of certain antipsychotic drugs (methiothepin, clozapine and thioridazine). However, other antipsychotic agents (chlorpromazine, haloperidol and pimozide) did not inhibit raphe cell firing. The inhibitory potency of these drugs on raphe activity correlates with reported central noradrenergic blocking efficacy. An alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, piperoxane, but not the beta-blocking agents, propranolol and MJ 1999, inhibited raphe activity when administered systemically. All of these drugs appear to act indirectly since they (and NE) have relatively weak or variable effects when applied microiontophoretically to raphe neurons. The depressant effects of certain antipsychotic drugs and piperoxane on 5HT neurons appears to be mediated by a cnetral adrenergic system since (1) the depression could be reversed by the catecholamine releasing agents 1- and d-amphetamine; (2) the depression could be abolished by destruction of adrenergic pathways in the CNS by chemical, mechanical, or electrothermic lesions. While a precise localization has not yet been obtained, the data suggest that these drug effects may be mediated by an adrenergic pathway ascending from the lower brainstem.", "pmid": "10173", "mesh_set": "D000818 D014150 D008297 D009474 D051381 D011941 D011985 D012154 D009435", "score": 19.027668, "rank": 2614, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of sperm whale myoglobin specifically enriched with 13C in the methionine methyl groups.", "abstract": "The Cepsilon methyl group of the 2 methionine residues in sperm whale myoglobin was enriched with respect to 13C. This was accomplished by treatment of the apomyoglobin at pH 4 at room temperature with a 100-fold proportion of 13CH3I to form an intermediate containing enriched S-methylmethionine. Unselective demethylation to regain the apomyoglobin structure was accomplished by treatment at pH 10.5 with 0.5 M dithioerythritol at 37 degrees for 18 h. Reagents were removed at each stage by dialysis against dilute sodium azide solution. Hemin was reincorporated to form the holoprotein in a way that avoided the presence of an excess of the small molecule. After chromatographic purification the enriched myoglobin was obtained in a yield of between 29 and 60%. The composition, absorbance spectrum, circular dichroism spectrum, isoionic point, electrophoretic behavior, and oxygen-binding behavior following reduction were all indistinguishable from those of the virgin protein. NMR measurements were made at 15.1, 25.2, and 67.9 MHz at 27-30 degrees. The two enriched loci are represented by separate resonances that appear slightly downfield of the spectral position of the corresponding resonance in free methionine. The positions of these resonances are sensitive to pH and to the ligand bound at the heme group which is approximately 17 A distant from each methionine Cepsilon. On the basis of two separate types of experiment the downfield resonance was assigned to methionine 55 and the upfield resonance to methionine 131. Part of the observed variations in chemical shift could be treated as arising from pseudocontact interactions but part was ascribed to structural changes communicated to the environment of each methionine residue as a result of changes in heme ligand, pH, or temperature. The linewidths of the methionine Cepsilon resonances are narrowed by increasing temperature according to an Arrhenius energy of activation of nearly 3 kcal. The spin-lattice relaxation times, T1, of the two methionine Cepsilon resonances at the three spectrometer frequencies were interpreted to indicate the existence of rotational motions in each side chain in addition to that about the Sdelta-Cepsilon bond. The results as a whole show that the two methionine side chains undergo continuous variations in environment, and that these variations are controlled by events at a distance within the protein structure. It is suggested that the structural lability serves the function of facilitating conformational variations and adjustments within the heme pocket.", "pmid": "12165", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D002247 D005583 D006863 D009682 D008715 D009211 D011485 D011487 D013816 D014907", "score": 7.7836695, "rank": 6121, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

This large molecular weight fraction, F-1, was not retarded by Sephadex G-100 as was hFSH, nor did it penetrate 7.5% acrylamide gel upon electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate as did hFSH. There was no evidence of dissociation of F-1 into smaller molecular weight fractions upon its refiltration through Sephadex G-100 or upon electrophoresis, suggesting F-1 was not an aggregate of smaller size proteins.

Based on gel filtration experiments, it seemed unlikely that immunologic activity against subunit antisera could be attributed to contamination of F-1 by free FSH subunits. The membrane binding activity of F-1 decreased after incubation with 8M urea, but at a rate less than 1/2 that seen with intact hFSH similarly treated, indicating the two activities were not identical.

Single motor units were recorded with highly selective electrodes from intact tibialis anterior muscle in the adult man. A detailed parametric analysis was made of the discharge patterns during voluntary isometric contractions of different peak forces carried out at various rates of force development. 2. During the smooth tracking of a ramp force, the different motor units recorded from a given muscle site were recruited in a consistant order, each unit becoming active when the muscle developed a certain level of force. The threshold of some of the units in such slow ramp contractions exceeded 8 kg. By contrast, in brisk ballistic contractions reaching a peak force of 12 kg in less than 0-15 sec, the same motor units discharged in a transient burst which largely preceded the muscle force production. 3. In slow tracking ramp contractions, the instantaneous frequency of single motor units was initially rather low (5-15/sec) and it increased as the ramp force augmented. By contrast, in (strong) ballistic contractions, the same units discharged at an unusually high instantaneous frequency (60-120/sec) early in the burst and the firing frequency decreased thereafter. Such hitherto unknown pattern appears characteristic of ballistic contractions and it was not found in even fast tracking ramp contractions achieving 12 kg in only 0-4 sec. 4. The potentials of the different motor units activated are rather crowded at intervals of a few msec in the early burst of a strong ballistic contraction and observations on the rank activation of the different motor units do not provide reliable data for the analysis of the recruitment order of units in ballistic contractions. 5. A new method is described for estimating ballistic force threshold of single motor units. When a large series of brisk ballistic contractions with peak forces ranging from 0-05 to 12 kg was carried out any given motor unit only became active when the ballistic peak force exceeded a certain reproducible value. A detailed analysis of the recruitment order based on these ballistic force thresholds showed it to be virtually identical to the recruitment order of the same units in slow tracking ramp contractions (correlation=0-95). 6. Ballistic contractions are graded in force both by the recruitment of additional motor units in stronger contractions, and by an increase in their rate of firing.

Measurements were made of the amounts of O6-methylguanine and 7-methylguanine present in liver DNA at 4 and 24 hours after treatment with the carcinogen. There was a linear relationship between 7-methylguanine levels and dose of the nitrosamine at both of these times. In contrast, the corresponding levels of O6-methylguanine were not directly proportional to dosage but were less than expected, particularly at low doses below 2.5 mg/kg. This discrepancy was significant at 4 hours, but was even more marked at 24 hours. Only doses above 4 mg/kg at the 4-hour time point gave rise to a 0.11 ratio of alkylation of guanine at the O6-position to that at the 7-position. This ratio was that expected for the initial interaction of the alkylating species derived from DMN with DNA. Evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that these results were due to an enzymatic removal of O6-methylguanine from liver DNA, which occurred much more efficiently at lower initial levels of alkylation. Repeated daily injections of DMN up to 11 days alos gave rise to O6-methylguanine levels that were not proportional to dosage but were relatively greater at higher dose levels.

{"title": "Lysine residues control the conformational dynamics of beta 2-glycoprotein I.", "abstract": "One of the major problems in the study of the dynamics of proteins is the visualization of changing conformations that are important for processes ranging from enzyme catalysis to signaling. A protein exhibiting conformational dynamics is the soluble blood protein beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI), which exists in two conformations: the closed (circular) form and the open (linear) form. It is hypothesized that an increased proportion of the open conformation leads to the autoimmune disease antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). A characteristic feature of beta2GPI is the high content of lysine residues. However, the potential role of lysine in the conformational dynamics of beta2GPI has been poorly investigated. Here, we report on a strategy to permanently open up the closed protein conformation by chemical acetylation of lysine residues using acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-Ac). Specific and complete acetylation was demonstrated by the quantification of primary amino groups with fluoraldehyde o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent, as well as western blot analysis with an anti-acetylated lysine antibody. Our results demonstrate that acetylated beta2GPI preserves its secondary and tertiary structures, as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy. We found that after lysine acetylation, the majority of proteins are in the open conformation as revealed by atomic force microscopy high-resolution images. Using this strategy, we proved that the electrostatic interaction of lysine residues plays a major role in stabilizing the beta2GPI closed conformation, as confirmed by lysine charge distribution calculations.

The molecular weights of the native enzyme and its subunits were 54,000-55,000 and 30,000-32,000, respectively. In general, the physiochemical and catalytic properties of bovine cerebral M-MDH was not very different from those of other corresponding mammalian enzymes. Incubation of the enzyme with Ag+ caused the loss of equivalent amounts of sulfhydryls with a parallel decrease of the enzymic activity. When the enzyme was exposed to 2-, 3.5-, and 5-fold molar excesses of Ag+, the enzymic activity showed an initial rapid fall and a subsequent slow restoration to a partially inactivated level (60-70, 45-50, and 15-20% of an untreated control, respectively), while the alpha-helical content of the enzyme fell exponentially with time. A 7-fold molar excess of Ag+ reduced both the enzymic activity and the alpha-helical content to a much greater degree and no restoration of the enzymic activity was observed. The Km values of Ag+-inactivated enzyme for NADH and oxaloacetate were the same as those of the native enzyme. The data suggest that Ag+ could inhibit enzymic activity both by reducing the structural regularity of the enzyme molecule and by attacking sulfhydryl groups necessary for the catalytic activity of bovine cerebral M-MDH.", "pmid": "2592", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D001921 D002417 D004305 D006863 D007700 D046911 D008291 D008928 D008970 D009243 D010071 D012834 D013439", "score": 14.881622, "rank": 4667, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "The effect of ascorbic acid on uric acid excretion with a commentary on the renal handling of ascorbic acid.", "abstract": "Under spontaneous conditions in man and dog, very little ascorbic acid is excreted in urine. Ascorbic acid clearance (C ascorbic acid) is promptly augmented when plasma ascorbic acid is increased by intravenous injection. No net tubular secretion of ascorbic acid is demonstrable in either man or dog when plasma ascorbic acid is elevated to levels as high as 12 mg/100 ml in man, and 28 mg/100 ml in the dog. Nevertheless, both in men and the Dalmatian dog, when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is decreased, excreted ascorbic acid in relation to the amount filtered is exaggerated so that C ascorbic acid:GFR approaches unity. It is possible that secreted ascorbic acid is masked under ordinary circumstances, with a more significant contribution of secreted ascorbic acid to total urinary ascorbic acid becoming apparent under conditions of low GFR. In man, when the plasma ascorbic acid level is raised to above 6 mg/100 ml, C urate:GFR rises from control value of 0.081 +/- 0.020, to 0.116 +/- 0.026. In both mongrel and Dalmatian dogs an effect of ascorbic acid on urate excretion is not conclusively shown. The uricosuric effect of ascorbic acid in man may be due to competition with uric acid for renal tubular reabsorptive transport.

A large part of the sucrase was found in the head while most of the rest was in the abdomen (a small amount was in the thorax). The enzyme precipitated between the same values of ammonium sulfate saturation as did the sucrase in honey and honey sucrase exhibited kinetics very similar to those of this enzyme. The enzyme was found to be a relatively nonspecific alpha-glucosidase and was shown to have transglucosidase activity. The production of glucose from sucrose was rectilinear when plotted by the Hofstee method at low substrate concentrations but decreased at high sucrose concentrations. The production of fructose was rectilinear throughout the concentration range used. The production of both glucose and rho-nitrophenol when rho nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucoside was the substrate was linear by the Hofstee plot. These effects were found to be due to transglucolysis and a mechanism of action is proposed. Amino acid and amino sugar analyses indicated that the sucrase was a glycoprotein. The molecular weight was found to be between 51000 and 82000 by three different methods and an so20.w value of 4.0 S was obtained. There was no evidence for subunit structure. Tests of the enzyme under various denaturation conditions did not reveal any unusual stabilities. The sucrase bound very tightly to a hydrophobic column.

In the presence of NADH and ubiquinone-1, the vesicles also generate a membrane potential (interior negative) that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of D-lactate. Stimulation of NADH-dependent transport by ubiquinone-1 cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of NADH, and the effect of the quinone on NADH-dependent lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of NADH dehydrogenase activity. Thus, it is apparent that ubiquinone-1 shunts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase [NADH:(acceptor)oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.3] to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energy-coupling site.

{"title": "Biochemical plasticity of synaptic transmission: a critical review of Dale's Principle.", "abstract": "\"Dale's Principle\" states that each neuron releases one and only one synaptic transmitter. Mental disorders and behavioral drug effects are attributed to activation or blockade of one or more of these specific transmitters. A series of biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies suggests the alternative view that at each monoaminergic synapse the action of the transmitter is modulated by several metabolically related substances: amine analogs (2-phenylethylamine [PEA], p-tyramine, etc.), deaminated products (aldehydes, acids, and alcohols), and possibly also amino acid precursors. In support of this view, the authors present evidence for the presence, synthesis, metabolism, and biological activity (at the cellular level, using microelectrode techniques) of amino acid, amines, and deaminated compounds metabolically related to catecholamines and sorotonin. That neuroamino acids exert direct effects (not mediated via their amine metabolites) is illustrated by the rapid effects of microiontophoretic dopa upon cortical unit activity, and by the observation that neither the lethargic effect of 5-hydroxytryptophan (considered to support Jouvet's serotonergic theory of sleep) nor the behavioral stimulant effects of dopa (considered to support the catecholamine theory of affective behavior) are significantly prevented by L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors. The biological activity of the deaminated metabolites of catecholamines and serotonin is illustrated by the effects of their microiontophoretic administration upon cortical units. Further, probenecid (an inhibitor of acid transport across the blood-brain barrier) is shown to qualitatively alter the effects of intraventricularly administered PEA and of its metabolite phenylacetic acid upon visual evoked potentials. Rabbit brain is shown to synthesize a series of pharmacologically active noncatecholic phenylethylamines as by-products of catecholamine metabolism. Amine modulators such as PEA differ from typical transmitters by their ability to cross biological barriers; inhibition of decarboxylase in peripheral tissues only (using alpha-methyldopa hydrazine) markedly depletes brain PEA (but not catecholamines). Because of the homeostatic control of the rate of transmitter synthesis and disposition, physiological, pharmacological, and pathological changes may be expected to affect more the tissue levels of related modulators. This modulator theory of drug action is illustrated by the effect of several psychotropic drugs upon the brain levels of PEA and of norepinephrine. For instance, amphetamine initially decreases and then increases brain PEA levels, without altering brain norepinephrine levels. The authors propose an expanded \"Dale's Principle\": each neuron is specific in that it releases at all its endings the same pool of chemical messengers, composed of one transmitter and metabolically related modulators, the relative proportion of which is determined by the physiological state of the cell (biochemical plasticity)...", "pmid": "9160", "mesh_set": "D006916 D000818 D001921 D002230 D003641 D004295 D005071 D006801 D001523 D008750 D009433 D009474 D018377 D010627 D011339 D011817 D051381 D011955 D013569 D009435 D014796", "label_true": "positive/labeled", "label_L100": "positive/labeled"}

The addition of calcium and magnesium to the hyperoncotic infusate diminished the natriuresis but did not alter the relationship between sodium and glucose reabsorption.

The decrease in SLMA was significantly antagonized by p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA). When rats pretreated with p-CPA were given 5-hydroxytryptophan before morphine injection, the marked sedative response to morphine was restored, suggesting that the morphine-induced decrease in SLMA of rats may depend on the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine by morphine. By contrast, the s.c. administration of 5 mg/kg of morphine-HCl produced a significant increase in SLMA of rats. The magnitude of the increase was reduced by atropine, scopolamine or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. It appears that both adrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms participate in the increase in SLMA of rats induced by morphine. Both the increase in SLMA produced by 5 mg/kg of morphine and the decrease in SLMA induced by 20 mg/kg of morphine were completely antagonized by the s.c. administration of naloxone-HCl, 0.0625 and 0.25 mg/kg, respectively.

In contrast, the same dose of the drug did not change the bradycardic response to stimulation of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) indicating that a central facilitation of baroreceptor impulses occurs within the NTS, probably at the first synapse of baroreceptor reflex fibres. Bilateral destruction of the NTS caused a fulminating hypertension and tachycardia similar to that after cutting the baroreceptor afferent fibres. After both procedures, fentanyl (20 mug/kg i.v.) produced marked hypotension and bradycardia. The bradycardic effect was abolished by cutting both vagal nerves when the dogs were pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent (S 2395, 50 mug/kg i.v.). The results provide evidence that the NTS is not the main site of action either for the hypotensive effect or for the vagally mediated bradycardia of fentanyl. Since the dorsal nucleus of the vagal nerve was destroyed together with the NTS, this nucleus does also not appear to be a major site of the action of fentanyl.

Thus 1 cysteine residue is at least 13-fold more reactive than its partner toward iodoacetamide at pH 7.6. This selectivity was demonstrated by reaction of the 2-electron reduced enzyme with a low concentration of iodo[1-14C]acetamide under anaerobic conditions. The formation of a monolabeled derivative is accompanied by the reappearance of a spectrum of oxidized bound flavin, clearly different from that of the native enzyme. Alkylation of the remaining cysteine residues with iodo[12C]acetamide enabled the isolation of a tryptic version of the active center disulfide peptide. A single chymotryptic cleavage between the 2 alkylated cysteine residues generated a cationic and an anionic fragment containing 7% and 93% of the radioactivity of the purified tryptic peptide, respectively. The monolabeled derivative is catalytically inactive toward reduced or oxidized lipoamide, but is approximately 2-fold better as a transhydrogenase than the native protein using NADH and acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide as substrates. Anaerobic titration with NADH leads to reduction of the flavin with concomitant formation of long wavelength absorption of low intensity.

{"title": "Patterns of fatty acid release from endogenous substrates by human platelet homogenates and membranes.", "abstract": "We describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes. The method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids. We found four types of lipolytic activities in human platelets. In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid. With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids. At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and stearic, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids. Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids. Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid. With this in mind, we raise the possibility that the phospholipase A2 of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane.", "pmid": "394", "mesh_set": "D001792 D002118 D002462 D002788 D004492 D005230 D006801 D006863 D007700 D010743 D014280", "score": 23.110325, "rank": 1365, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The analysis led to a formulation (somewhat similar to the Michaelis-Menten equation for enzyme kinetics) in which a parameter, I1/2, is defined as the actinic light intensity that, at a given concentration of electron donro, renders the reaction-center pigment half oxidized and half reduced. To determine the role of a presumed reaction-center pigment, I1/2 is compared with another parameter, equivalent to I1/2, that is obtained independently of the reaciton-center pigment by measuring the effect of actinic light intensity and concentration of electron donor on the overall electron flow. The theory was tested and validated in a model system with spinach Photosystem I chloroplast fragments by measurements of photooxidation of P-700 and light-induced reduction of NADP+ by reduced 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol.

All three cements exhibited a cytotoxic effect, which was most pronounced in the cultures with zinc silicophosphate cement and polycarboxylate cement. The results also indicated that cell growth on the surface of the disks is a more sensitive indicator of cytotoxicity than cell growth around the disks. pH of the medium was only slightly affected in cultures with polycarboxylate cement, whereas a decrease was found in cultures with zinc phosphate cement and especially with zinc silicophosphate cement. A rapid release of phosphate was found in cultures with zinc silicophosphate cement. Zinc was released into the medium from disks of zinc phosphate cement, zinc silicophosphate cement and polycarboxylate cement--exceeding the toxicity level for the present cell line after 24 h.

Not only are host radiosensitive lymphocytes of systemic origin necessary for the manifestation of normal PLN hypertrophy, but as few as 2.5 X 10(6) parental lymph node cells (LNCs) injected into the hind footpad of adult F1 hybrid rats disseminate widely, provoking significant systemic GVH reactions, as measured by splenomegaly, and distant lymphadenopathy. Futhermore, locally injected donor LNCs ultimately engender three forms of attenuated GVH reactivity: (1) the dissipation of potentially unlimited GVH reactivity, (2) refractoriness of the host to subsequent rechallenge by GVH-inducing cells, and (3) progressive loss of GVH reactivity in donor LNCs when serially transferred to secondary F1 recipients. Whether this modulation of the cell-mediated immune response is the expression of an anti-recognition structure response by the host or the activation of some other immunoregulatory protein, it is absent or reduced in splenectomized recipients.

When the washed, minced oviducts were incubated at 37 degrees with the buffer, intracellular proteins were increasingly secreted to the extracellular fluids as the incubation time was increased and the amounts of intracellular proteins decreased concomitatnly, suggesting that the rate of secretion of intracellular proteins was faster than that of protein synthesis under the conditions used (without addition of amino acids to the medium). Repeated 5-min incubations (five to seven times) resulted in the secretion of intracellular proteins in amounts of 100 mg or more per g of the wet oviducts. The secretion rate of intracellular proteins was almost constant at 77 degrees regardless of the volume of buffer used for the incubation, and no secretion occurred at 4 degrees even after 5 h. It appeared that a 30 min period was required for the secretion of intracellular proteins from the oviducts at 37 degrees and that the rate of secretion was not affected appreciably by the amount of secreted proteins present in the extracellular fluids.

Hence, the failure to assign the maximal magnesium stoichiometry to enzyme isolated by conventional procedures may be considered a consequence of the conditions chosen for optimal bacterial growth and purification of the enzyme which are not the conditions for optimal binding of magnesium to alkaline phosphatase. Under the conditions employed for the present experimental studies, a maximum of six metal sites are available to bind zinc and magnesium, i.e., four for zinc and two for magnesium. Magnesium alone does not activate the apoenzyme, but it regulates the nature of the zinc-dependent restoration of catalytic activity to apophosphatase, increasing the activity of enzyme containing 2-g-atoms of zinc five-fold and that of enzyme containing 4-g-atoms of zinc 1.4-fold. Moreover, hydrogen-tritium exchange reveals the stabilizing effects of magnesium on the structural properties of phosphatase. However, neither the KM for substrate nor the phosphate binding stoichiometry and Ki are significantly altered by magnesium. Hence, magnesium, which is specificially bound to the enzyme, both stabilizes the dynamic protein structure and regulates the expression of catalytic activity by zinc in alkaline phosphatase.", "pmid": "13822", "mesh_set": "D000469 D001665 D003956 D004926 D006863 D007700 D008274 D011485 D015032", "score": 12.831184, "rank": 5511, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Epidermis removed not only from the lesions, but also from normal-appearing skin, responded abnormally. The increase in intracellular levels of cAMP after exposure to catecholamines was similar in normal and atopic epidermis. Lymphocytes and PMN leukocytes isolated from patients with atopic dermatitis show both a decreased physiologic response (glycogenolysis and inhibition of lysosome enzyme release) and a decreased rise in intracellular levels of cAMP upon incubation with beta agonists, but a normal response to PGE1. Cortisol increases the response of lymphocyte adenyl cyclase to both agonists and, in the case of the patients with atopic disease, more than overcomes the depressed response to beta agonists.

In contrast to the previously reported observation that antihistaminic potency decreased with prolongation of the preincubation time, histamine antagonism by the aziridine compounds remained at a constant level for more than 60 min in the presence of indomethacin.

A 44% reduction in the volume of saliva and elevations in the salivary concentrations of K+, Ca2+ and protein were found in the treated animals after pilocarpine stimulation. Similarly, a 25% reduction in salivary volume and elevations in salivary Ca2+ and protein concentrations were observed following stimulation with carbamylcholine. A less significant elevation in salivary K+ was seen after this secretagogue. The Na+ and protein contents, but not the K+ and Ca2+ contents, were found to be elevated in the glands of the treated animals in the resting (unstimulated) state. After stimulation with the two secretagogues, however, similar changes in glandular Na+ and K+ contents were found in the glands of control and treated animals. The glandular water content was also similar in both types of glands in the resting and stimulated states. It is concluded that a reduced salivary secretion, rather than supersensitivity, is observed in the rat submaxillary gland following chronic guanethidine administration. The drug treatment does not impair the glandular electrolyte changes that occur upon stimulation, but most likely impairs the release of protein from the gland and also transductal K+ transport.

Initially the plasma concentrations of glycyl-leucine and glycylglycine were higher in nephrectomized than in control rats but later the concentrations were similar in both groups of rats. The disappearance of these two dipeptides from plasma was almost complete within 20 min, and their plasma half-lives were not changed remarkably by nephrectomy. In contrast, nephrectomy markedly impaired disappearance of glycylsarcosine from plasma and prolonged its half-life from 7-6 min to 52-0 min. 3. Glycyl-leucine and glycylglycine were not detected in tissues of control rats injected with these dipeptides, but glycylsarcosine was recovered from all four tissues examined.

Krebs-Ringer phosphate solutions (pH 6.2 and 7.4), Krebs-Ringer pyrophosphate solution (pH 8.4), or an unbuffered salt solution containing a drug were administered through tight-fitting tracheal cannulas to anesthetized animals. After 3 min, the lungs were removed and assayed for the amount of drug that remained. Weak acids and a weak base were absorbed most rapidly at pH values at which the drugs were least ionized. For example, with the base procainamide, 36% of the dose was absorbed at pH 6.2 and 76% at pH 8.4. With the acid sulfisoxazole, 71% was absorbed at pH 6.2 and 55% at pH 8.4. Similarly, with p-aminosalicylic acid, 77% was absorbed at pH 6.2 and 40% at pH 8.4. In contrast to these results, compounds such as urea and amitrole, which remain completely nonionized over the pH range studied, showed no change in absorption rate when the pH was varied. The two weak acids and the weak base were absorbed from an unbuffered solution as though the pH at the site of drug absorption was between 6.2 and 7.4. The absorption rate for each weak electrolyte from unbuffered solution, when compared graphically with the respective absorption rates from buffered solutions, indicated that the pH at the site of drug absorption is about 6.6.", "pmid": "15810", "mesh_set": "D000042 D010131 D000640 D000818 D001665 D002404 D006863 D008168 D008297 D004364 D011342 D051381 D013444 D014132 D014508 D014835", "score": 12.715533, "rank": 5550, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The relative potency values (isoprenaline = 100) on the K(+)-depolarized preparation were fenoterol 74.1, salbutamol 15.1, rimiterol 13.5, terbutaline 8.2 and orciprenaline 5.6.4 The relative potency values obtained on uterine preparations were less than three-fold different from those previously found for guinea-pig trachea (after inhibition of extraneuronal uptake).5 The pA(2) value for propranolol on the K(+)-depolarized uterine preparations was 9.13.6 It is concluded that the K(+)-depolarized guinea-pig uterine preparation can be used for quantitative studies on beta-adrenoceptor stimulant drugs.

The increase in filtered fluid and sodium was nearly completely matched by increased tubular reabsorption. Thus, only a small rise in urine flow and in urinary sodium excretion was observed. The micropuncture experiments using the split oil droplet method of Gertz demonstrated a stimulation of the transepithelial fluid transfer after injection of dopamine (10(-4) M) into the proximal tubular lumen. This effect was abolished by simultaneous injection of propranolol (10(-3) M) which, by its own, did not affect transtubular volume fluxes.

Aphids without claws were able to transmit the virus. Transmission thus seems similar to that of nonpersistent viruses. The ratio of virus to polyamino acid, as well as the KCl concentration, markedly affected transmission. Transmission was best from mixtures which contained 250 mug/ml TMV, 2-5 MUG/ML PLO (mol. wt. 120000) and 0-6 M-KCl. A similar mixture favoured transmission when poly-L-lysine (mol. wt. 85000) was substituted for PLO, but with poly-L-lysine (mol. wt. 30 000) it was necessary to decrease the KCl to 0-3 M to obtain transmission. Less KCl (0-08 to 0-24 M) also favoured aphid transmission of PLO-treated potato virus X and tobacco rattle virus. PLO-treated TMV ultracentrifuged in the presence of, and resuspended in, 0-6 M-KCl remained aphid  transmissible while PLO-treated virus in 2 M-DCl, which favours greater dissociation of the virus-PLO complex, was transmissible neither before nor after sedimentation by ultracentrifuging, and resuspension in 0-6 M-KCl. these results show that transmissibility is not due to a permanent alteration of the virus by PLO and indicate that the formation of a TMV-PLO complex is required for transmission. Sequential acquisition experiments suggest that PLO may act by binding TMV to receptor sites in aphids.

Treatment with adriamycin (18 X 1 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in significant augmentation of the cardiotoxic effects of this drug demonstrated by electrocardiographic measurements and myocardial histopathology. Adriamycin-induced atrophy of the lymphatic tissue was seen only in rats fed HFD and not in animals receiving ground chow. Adriamycin levels in the heart after single i.p. injection were higher in rats receiving HFD. This effect was present already after 10 days on HFD. At this time histopathological liver changes were present and SGPT was elevated. It is concluded that the increase in adriamycin toxicity is, at least in part, due to diminished excretion by the liver.

{"title": "Effects of methylprednisolone on coronary blood flow and myocardial metabolism during cardiopulmonary bypass.", "abstract": "Corticosteroids frequently are used during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to enhance total body perfusion and myocardial preservation. The mechanisms by which steroids might provide protection to the myocardium have not been clearly defined, however. Therefore this study was performed to measure the effects of methylprednisolone (M-P) on coronary flow and distribution, and on myocardial metabolism and contractility. Twenty-three dogs underwent 1 hour of total CPB, 80 cc/kg/minute at normothermia with beating hearts. Alternate animals received M-P, 30 mg/kg. Myocardial blood flow (microspheres technique), myocardial tissue lactate and adenosine triphosphate, lactate extraction, coronary sinus flow (CSF), and coronary vascular resistance (CVR) were measured before, during, and 60 minutes after bypass. LV dp/dt and cardiac output (CO) were measured before and after bypass. Total coronary flow was significantly higher in the M-P group after 10 and 30 minutes of bypass (93 vs 56 ml/100 gm/minute, p less than 0.05, and 96 vs 71 ml/100 gm/minute, p less than 0.05). Right ventricular flow was higher in the M-P group at 10 and 30 minutes of bypass (98 vs 66 ml/100 gm/minute, p less than 0.05, and 90 vs 78 ml/100 gm/minute). Left ventricular flow was higher in the M-P group at 10 minutes of bypass (79 vs 52 ml/100 gm/minute, p less than 0.08). Septal flow also was higher in the treated group at 10 minutes of bypass (64 vs 49 ml/100 gm/minute) and at 30 minutes of bypass (92 vs 67 ml/100 gm/minute, p less than 0.05). CVR after 10 minutes of bypass was lower in the steroid group (88 mm Hg/ml/100 gm/minute vs 1.39 in the control group, p less than 0.03).

Optimum activities for these three enzymes are shown at pH values of 5.2, 6.5 and 7.3. The activity at pH6.5 is the only one evident without metal-ion activation, but activity is enhanced by all three metal ions. The activity at pH 5.2 is seen only in the presence of Fe2+ or Co2+, and the activity at pH7.3 is seen only in the presence of Co2+ or Mn2+ and in a non-chelating buffer medium. 4.

In addition, the relationship between bile lipid composition and the proportions of the bile acids was examined. Bile-rich duodenal fluid was collected twice in the first week and then at approximately weekly intervals for four to six weeks, from six gallstone patients starting 13-15 mg CDCA.kg BW-1 day-1 and from another group of six patients whose treatment was stopped after gallstone dissolution. After starting treatment, the mean biliary cholesterol saturation index (based on criteria of Hegardt and Dam, 1971) decreased from 1-49 +/- SEM 0-17 to 0-92 +/- 0-13 at three weeks and 0-88 +/- 0-10 at four weeks, by which time bile lipid composition had become relatively constant. In patients whose treatment was stopped, bile reverted to its supersaturated state within one week, changing from an on-treatment mean saturation index of 0-74 +/- 0-10 to 1-15 +/- 0-15 in six to eight days after withdrawing CDCA. The proportion of conjugated CDCA in the biliary bile acids increased from 27-9 +/- 2-5% to 60-5 +/- 4-2% within four days and to 80-7 +/- 6-2% by four weeks after starting CDCA.

{"title": "Oscillation of acetylcholine during nerve activity in the Torpedo electric organ.", "abstract": "The amount of transmitter in the electric organ of Torpedo was measured with a time resolution of 1 sec in the course of stimulation. In parallel, the modifications of the electrophysiological response were analysed by determining the conductance increase (deltaG) and the electromotive force of electroplaques. Large changes in the level of total acetylcholine (ACh) were seen during stimulation. These changes were two-fold: a slow wave and, superimposed on it, a rapid oscillation. The slow wave raised total ACh to the initial level, or even higher. It was probably related to modifications in the amount of ACh released since it corresponded to characteristic inflections in the evolution of the deltaG curve. The slow wave and this physiological parameter were similarly affected when the experiments were performed at a reduced temperature. The rapid oscillation had an amplitude of about 20-40% of the total ACh. It was undamped and its period was 4-5 sec. In contrast to the slow wave, no clear physiological change associated with the rapid oscillation has been observed. The slow wave and rapid oscillation occurred in the 'free pool' of ACh, whereas bound ACh, the fraction associated with synaptic vesicles, was not affected by these changes. A dynamic description of synaptic activity is proposed. The content of 'free' ACh is used and renewed completely after a few tens of impulses, so that transmission seems to imply the continual recycling of the same pool of transmitter rather than utilization of a large preloaded store. The release process must then be integrated in rapid metabolic loops.", "pmid": "856404", "mesh_set": "D000109 D000200 D000818 D004557 D004593 D005071 D008564 D013696 D013997", "score": 16.726582, "rank": 3716, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Ganglioside GD1a taken up by cell membranes is hydrolyzed faster membrane-bound neuraminidase than are water-soluble substrates of the enzyme, sialyllactitol and des-GD1a. Availability and enzymic breakdown of the disialoganglioside are enhanced by general anesthetics such as N2O or halothane whereas the degradation of the hydrophilic substrate silayllactitol is not affected or even is decreased by these agents. General anesthetics lower the microviscosity of membranes as indicated by studies of fluorescence depolarization with the indicator 1,6-diphenylhexatriene. Increased fluidity can result in higher lateral diffusion of ganglioside GD1a, thus increasing its chances of presentation to, and interaction with, membrane-bound neuraminidase.

Semithin epon sections of occipital cortex were stained with toluidine blue; neurons and the three main types of glia were enumerated. In addition, the thickness of the cortex was measured and the glial cells of corpus callosum counted in the animals exposed to the three environments for 80 days. Under the influence of the enriched environment, the occipital cortex enlarged, the number of oligodendrocytes increased over the controls by 27-33% in the 30- and 80-day groups and the number of astrocytes, by 13% in the 80-day group. Within the cortex, only certain layers showed the increase in glial numbers. In the corpus callosum, however, the numbers of glial cells did not differ from those in controls. In the animals exposed to the impoverished environment, neither the size of the cortex nor the number of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes differed from controls. The animals subjected to handling also showed evidence of cortical enlargement, but the only significant change in glial cells was a 12% increase in astrocytes. It is concluded that handling and enrichment produce changes in anatomical indices of neural function including depth of cortex and numbers of glial cells. The glial response was specific to the type.of manipulation since astrocytes were predominantly affected by handling and oligodendrocytes, by enrichment. The effect of handling on astrocytes may be attributed to the stimulation being applied at a time of astrocyte proliferation, whereas the effect of enriched environment on oligodendrocytes occurred at a time of active production of these cells. The differences in cell numbers were explained by changes in the rate of cell population growth; since the impoverished did not differ from the control animals, the changes probably consisted of growth acceleration in the enriched animals rather than diminution in the impoverished ones.", "pmid": "838881", "mesh_set": "D000818 D000831 D002452 D002540 D003337 D006234 D009457 D009474 D009778 D051381 D012931 D012934 D013391", "score": 10.875652, "rank": 5966, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The total urinary and fecal excretion of labeled drug and metabolites after iv and oral administration of 14C-bumetanide was estimated in dogs given 0.5 mg/kg and in rats given 5 mg/kg. In the dog, the primary excretion product was unchanged drug, although evidence was obtained that the acyl glucuronide of bumetanide was secreted in dog bile. The major metabolite excreted by the rat was I, and negligible quantities of intact drug were excreted in the urine after oral or iv administration.

An operational criterion for defining sensitization of patients' leukocytes was developed; i.e., evidence in an individual sample of leukocytes of either decreased or increased migration areas (migration index less than or equal to 0.79 and larger than or equal to 1.20, respectively) with 3 or more antigen extracts.

Patients with various nongastric cancers were sensitized in 36% (49/135) of cases. Gastritis and gastric, as well as duodenal, ulcer did not influence the reactivity of patients' leukocytes, but considerable sensitization was found in patients with atrophic gastritis or intestinalization. When classified in the usual manner, i.e., by considering the reaction with individual tumor extracts, the specificity and the sensitivity of the test was markedly diminished: More false negative determinations were found in the group of gastric cancer patients, and the percentage of false positives in the group of nonmalignant diseases increased. The results gave evidence of tumor-associated antigens in gastric cancer patients, against which the host elicited a cellular immune response.

{"title": "Some metabolic approaches to improving myocardial performance during cardiac hypoxia.", "abstract": "Four possible metabolic approaches to improving cardiac function in the presence of myocardial hypoxia have been considered. 1. It appears that there is increasing evidence which suggests that free fatty acids are harmful to the ischemic heart. 2. Although it has been demonstrated that Krebs cycle intermediates can result in anaerobic energy formation by the mitochondria, and under certain extreme conditions can lead to improved performance of the heart, the potential for a physiologically important effect of this approach is probably limited. 3. The protection of the ischemic or hypoxic heart by alkalosis may be a feasible approach. The major beneficial effect appears to be exerted through more efficient conversion of energy that is already available to contractile performance rather than by increasing energy supply. 4. There appears to be some real potential for improving cardiac energy delivery via the glycolytic pathway. Calculations based on isolated rat heart studies indicate that, at 50% oxygenation, glycolytic ATP generation could totally correct for the deficit in mitochondrial ATP formation. Therefore, it is in the area of overcoming the inhibition of glycolytic ATP formation and tapping this potential metabolic pathway that energy delivery may be restored toward normal in the hypoxic and perhaps the borderline zone of underperfusion in the ischemic heart. The problem of the ischemic inhibition of glycolysis may partially be overcome by creating extracellular alkalosis, but this presumption will have to be tested.", "pmid": "1830", "mesh_set": "D000255 D000471 D000693 D000818 D004734 D005230 D005947 D006003 D006019 D006321 D006863 D000860 D008931 D009206 D012110 D013314", "score": 13.892861, "rank": 5124, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Fentanyl caused less depression than pethidine or its metabolites excepting normeperidinic acid.

After ip administration of [14C]acetylhydrazine, 36% and 38% of the dose was recovered in the urine and as 14CO2, respectively. The major urinary metabolites were diacetylhydrazine and the pyruvic acid and alpha-oxoglutaric acid acetylhydrazones. The acetylation of acetylhydrazine to diacetylhydrazine was found to be dose-dependent and to be inhibited by coadministered isoniazid and p-aminosalicylic acid. Coadministered acetylisoniazid had no effect on acetylation. The proportion of acetylhydrazine recovered as 14CO2 presumably reflects the amount metabolized by the microsomal oxidation pathway, thought to be responsible for the toxicity, and also possibly by hydrolysis to acetate and hydrazine. This latter pathway could not be confirmed, as only a small proportion of hydrazine administered to rats was recovered. The inhibition of acetylation by p-aminosalicyclic acid, but not isoniazid, significantly increased the excretion of 14CO2, suggesting that isoniazid may also inhibit a pathway resulting in the production of 14CO2.

The biochemical and secretory properties of these cells in long term cultures (up to 2 wk) were compared. TA-elicited macrophages contained more protein, lactate dehydrogenase, lysosomal hydrolases, and in particular, more plasminogen activator than the other cells studied. All types of macrophages studied were found to release considerable amounts of lysosomal hydrolases (beta-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase, and acid phosphatase) into the medium. Release was independent of phagocytosis and must, therefore, be regarded as true secretion. In both elicited and nonelicited macrophages, the rates of lysosomal enzyme secretion were virtually identical in the presence and in the absence of serum, and they were not enhanced by increasing serum concentrations. Lysosomal enzyme secretion in macrophages appears to depend on protein synthesis, since it was blocked by low concentrations of cycloheximide which neither affected cell viability nor lowered the intracellular enzyme levels. The amounts of lysosomal hydrolases secreted were highest in TA-elicited macrophages. The rates of secretion of PP- or SA-elicited and of nonelicited macrophages were about one-fourth of that of the TA-elicited cells. This difference, although significant, is much smaller than that observed for the secretion of plasminogen activator which was 20-50 times higher in TA-elicited cells. Acid glycosidases were also found in the peritoneal lavage media used for cell harvesting from both treated and nontreated mice.

Two of these compounds, 6f and 6j, were potent beta-adrenoreceptor agonists in in vitro tests that measure a compound's ability to relax guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle and to increase the rate of contraction of guinea pig right atria. Several compounds had a dose-dependent effect.

On the basis of these pharmacological results, coupled with NMR spectral data, it appears that the previous suggestion that aryloxypropanolamines interact with beta-adrenocreceptors as a consequence of their ability to assume an orientation in which the benzene ring the ethanolamine moieties can be superimposed on those of corresponding adrenergic phenylethanolamines is invalid.

{"title": "Effect of starvation, nutriment replacement, and hypothyroidism on in vitro hepatic T4 to T3 conversion in the rat.", "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of starvation, oral and i.v. nutriments, and hypothyroidism on the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to 3,3', 5-triiodothyronine (T3) in the rat and mouse, an in vitro system for assessing T4 conversion to T3 by fresh liver homogenates was used. A 2-day starvation in the rat reduced hepatic T3 generation from T4 by 47% +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SE) in six separate experiments and also impaired the metabolism of 125I-r-T3. Administration of carbohydrate (CHO) and amino acids (P), but not lipid (L), significantly increased T3 generation above values observed in the starved rat. The mean serum glucose concentration was similar in all nutriment-infused groups, but serum insulin was significantly greater in the CHO- and P-infused as compared to the L-infused rats. These findings suggest that CHO and P, but not L, are important modulators of hepatic outer ring thyronine deiodination in the rat, perhaps due to increased intracellular glucose. Hypothyroidism in the rat induced by thyroidectomy and congenital secondary hypothyroidism in the dwarf mouse resulted in a striking decrease in hepatic conversion of T4 to T3. This decrease was restored to normal by the daily s.c. administration of physiologic doses of T4 (1.5 microgram/100 g) or T3 (0.5 microgram/100 g) for 14 days, and was increased above normal following treatment of normal rate with greater than physiologic doses of T4 (3microgram/100 g) or T3 (1 microgram/100g). In vitro hepatic conversion of T4 to T3 is, therefore, dependent upon thyroid function. Since 2-days starvation in the rat was associated with decreased serum concentrations of T4, T3, and TSH, and hypothyroidism resulted in decreased conversion of T4 to T3, the effect of a constant 2-day infusion of physiologic doses of T4 or T3 in the starved rat on the in vitro deiodination of T4 was assessed. Thyroid hormone replacement did not enhance the conversion of T4 to T3 in the starved rat. These observations suggest that the starvation-induced decrease in hepatic generation of T3 from T4 is not due to hypothyroidism and that the mechanism(s) of the decreased T3 production observed in starvation and hypothyroidism is different.", "pmid": "30020", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D001786 D004032 D004040 D004393 D006863 D007037 D066298 D007328 D050356 D008099 D008297 D051379 D051381 D013217 D013696 D013974 D014284", "score": 18.970915, "rank": 2640, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction of the crayfish walking leg has been found to deviate from binomial predictions immediately after the onset of repetitive stimulation of the presynaptic nerve at frequencies of at least 15 Hz. 2. After several minutes of continuous stimulation, and at lower rates of stimulation, however, the number of quanta released could be described quite well by binomial or Poisson statistics. 3. Deviations from the theoretical expectations were characterized by (a) fewer release failures than predicted, (b) occasions in which the number of quanta released was more than the estimated number of quanta available for release, and (c) a tendency for the data to be underdispersed. 4. Each of these three characteristics are consistent with the hypothesis that different releasable quanta may have different probabilities of responding to a nerve impulse. 5. Using two different methods, different values of the non-uniform probabilities were estimated from the data. At each synaptic site at least one of the estimated probabilities was very high. 6.

When the externum was acidic and the internum neutral, the gradient was increased by the drug. The effect of butacaine was similar to that of propranolol, while procaine, timolol and practolol were ineffective. It is suggested that the charged form of propranolol is bound to the membrane and dislocates protons from binding sites in the membrane and that the uncharged form of propranolol penetrates the membrane. After penetration it could associate with protons in the intraliposomal compartment and hence increase the pH of the interior.

Unlike the latter, Lu 3-049 and desipramine possessed weak inhibitory effects on serotonin uptake in brain or spleen. Brain norepinephrine levels were unaltered following single or repeated doses of either agent. Desipramine caused a marked increase in norepinephrine turnover; Lu 3-049 caused no change or a slight decrease in turnover.

The major metabolites known to date are bromoethylbutyramide, ethylbutyrylurea and inorganic bromide. After ingestion of a therapeutic dose of 1.0 g carbromal (4.2 mmoles) by four healthy volunteers highest concentrations in serum were found to be for carbromal 30 mumoles/l, for bromoethylbutyramide up to 20 mumoles/l and for ethylbutyrylurea 2--3 mumoles/l. In patients acutely poisoned by carbromal-containing sedatives serum concentrations measured were in the range of 200 mumoles/l carbromal, 350 mumoles/l bromoethylbutyramide and 50 mumoles/l ethylbutyrylurea. These patients were comatose, apneic, had isoelectric encephalographic records and decreased body temperature. The degree of central nervous depression as judged by clinical signs was found to correlate with the serum concentrations of carbromal and of bromoethylbutyramide. Pharmacological activity and acute toxicity of carbromal and its two metabolites were examined in rats and compared with the activity of phenobarbitone.

The effects of such a deficiency on the developing causate nucleus might be used to provide insight into structure and function of the normal subcortical brain, as well as possible influences of these extrapyramidal structures on mental retardation. Propylthiouracil was added to the diet of lactating rat dams and observations of the developing caudate nuclei of normal hypothyroid rats were made at 8, 14, 20, 30 and 42 days by using various tissue stains and Golgi-Cox preparations. Seven different types of neurons were distinguished in the caudate nucleus. Differences in the size of cell somata and the varying morphology of axons and dendrites were criteria used to make distinctions. Normally, the nucleus acquires cytoarchitectural complexity during the first three postnatal weeks. Within this period, neuron incidence increases in the caudate neuropil with age while the germinal matrix density decreases. Neuron accumulation reaches a plateau after the third week and cell migration is essentially complete at the end of the first postnatal month as shown by computer analysis of Nissl stained cell counts. Branching of cellular processes, attainment of receptor spines and complexity of the fiber network also appeared during this period. Retardation of structural development with thyroid hormone deficiency was shown by decreased numbers of neurons, inhibition of dendritic arborization, decreased numbers of dendritic spines and a reduced complexity of axonal plexuses. Thyroid deficiency delays cell migration during the first three weeks when compared to age-matched normal controls. The lack of thyroid hormone does not appear to influence the size of neuron somata, and the extent of related dendritic fields, nor does hypothyroidism affect a specific cell type population. Generalized disturbances of caudate nuclear morphological maturation are caused by the deficiency. An apparent compensatory process, including a spurt of neural growth and differentiation, takes place in the period between days 14 and 30 in the deficient animals and a seemingly \"normal\" caudate cytoarchitecture is seen after the third postnatal week. Quantitative data, however, show that this rapid \"catch up\" process is inadequate.

The average elimination half-life of hexobarbital had decreased from 407 to 171 min and its metabolic clearance had increased almost threefold. In contrast, the average elimination half-life of antipyrine was virtually the same on both occasions (6.9 and 7.2 hr) and there was no change in metabolic clearance. In a tuberculous patient treated with rifampicin the antipyrine elimination rate was unaffected. Rifampicin did not influence indocyanine green clearance or galactose elimination capacity. Serum gamma glutamyl transferase was not affected but urinary D-glucaric acid excretion was increased during rifampicin treatment. The experiment with hexobarbital was repeated after 2 weeks in all subjects; half-lives and clearance values had returned to near control values.

The extent to which skeletal involvement in hyperparathyroidism can be detected by X-ray remains an unsolved issue. The present investigation, aimed at resolving this problem, was carried out in 44 patients with primary (PHPT) and 57 subjects with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) due to terminal renal insufficiency. For comparison, 49 age-matched controls were included in this series. Subperiostal resorption of the phalanges of the hand was considered pathognomonic and graded according to a semiquantitative system using a magnifying lens. The data were compared with the serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase values. 2. Pathological subperiostal resorption was detected in 38.5% of the PHPT and in 56% of the SHPT patients while the controls showed 4% (false) positive results. A highly significant correlation between the extent of bone resorption and alkaline phosphatase was found (PHPT: r=0.80, SHPT: r=0.71, p less than 0.001). No correlation of the X-ray findings to the serum calcium could be detected. Compared to the degree of skeletal involvement demonstrated by X-ray, the alkaline phosphatase was significantly lower in SHPT than in PHPT. In PHPT on the other hand, subperiostal resorption was prominent among female patients aged over 40 years, while no prevalence for sex and age was found in the SHPT group. 3. These results demonstrate that a clinically relevant degree of bone involvement in hyperparathyroidism may be easily and reliability assessed by evaluating X-rays of the hands by means of a magnifying lens. Increased bone resorption in hyperparathyroidism appears to be paralleled by an increase of osteoblastic activity as assessed by elevation of alkaline phosphatase. In SHPT due to chronic renal failure, however, a relative osteoblastic insufficiency seems to exist. In PHPT, the prevalence of subperiostal bone resorption in women aged over 40 years may be compatible with a skeletal protecting effect of intact ovarian function (estrogens).", "pmid": "847437", "mesh_set": "D000328 D000469 D001862 D002118 D004967 D005260 D006225 D006801 D006961 D006962 D007676 D008875 D010006 D011859", "score": 7.712969, "rank": 6123, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Mice infected with influenza had a 57% and 65% depression of total leukocyte and macrophage accumulation, respectively, as compared to the response of uninfected mice. In contrast, bacterial pneumonia did not produce a decrease in the macrophage response. This indicated that the depression was produced by the virus infection rather than being a nonspecific phenomenon accompanying any inflammatory focus in the lung. The in vitro chemotactic responsiveness of normal peritoneal macrophages incubated with infectious influenza virus was 53% of normal.

Of the eleven pH indicators, those other than alpha-naptholphthalein, o-cresolphthalein and phenolphthalein, when assayed at appropriate concentrations, inhibited ATP-Pi exchange, but not ATP hydrolysis. In ATP-Pi exchange, these eight pH indicators at the concentrations described above were competitive against Pi, and non-competitive against ATP. The remaining three kinds of pH indicators were non-competitive against either Pi or ATP, when assayed at concentrations of the dyes that inhibited both activities. 3. The amounts of pH indicators bound with chromatophores were measured. No correlation was found between the amounts of the bound dyes and the extents of their inhibition of either ATP formation or ATP-Pi exchange. 4. Ethyl orange (pKa=4.1) and 2, 4-dinitrophenol (pKa=3.9) stimulated ATP hydrolysis to the greatest extent. The latter dye was hardly bound with chromatophores. 5.

The permeabilities to urea, thiourea and to N-methylurea (about 10(-6) cm/sec at 25 degrees C) were independent of concentration within a very broad range, and we found no evidence of interaction between transport of analogue molecules. The activation energies were between 17 and 19 kcal/mole, and urea transport was not inhibited by phloretin, which inhibits urea transport in mammalian red cells. 3. The water permeability of chicken red cells (as measured by the diffusion of tritiated water) was 1-35 X 10(-3) cm/sec at 25 degrees C. The activation energy was 10 kcal/mole, and the water permeability was not affected by phloretin or parachloromercuribenzoate. 4. It is concluded that the urea and water permeabilities of the chicken erythrocyte membrane are similar to those of a non-porous bimolecular phospholipid membrane. 5. Like the red cells of other animal species the chicken red cell membrane contains an anion transport system, mediating a rapid exchange of chloride across the cell membranes. The pH dependence, temperature dependence, and sensitivity to inhibitors were similar to the properties of the anion transport system found in mammalian red cells.

There is no preferential in vitro inhibition of induced versus control oxidoreductase activities by either alpha-naphthoflavone or metyrapone. In 3-methylcholanthrene-treated F1 and F2 progeny and offspring from backcrosses between the F1 and either C57BL/6N or DBA/2N parent, however, there is not a strict correlation between induced or noninducible aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and oxidoreductase activities. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, at doses (80 mug kg-1) sufficiently high to induce the hydroxylase almost as well in DBA/2N as in C57BL/6N mice, induces the oxidoreductase about 3-fold in C57BL/6N and less than 50% in DBA/2N mice.

Propranolol (10(8) and 10(5) mol/1) inhibits the lipolysis in the adipose tissue of all age groups stimulated by isoprenalin (10(6)and 10(5) mol/1). The following Ki-values were calculated: 2x10(6) mol/1in the tissue of adults, 0.5 x 10(6) mol/1 in the infantile adipose tissue, 0.2 X 10(6) mol/1 in the tissue of old persons. Phentolamine (10(5) mol/1) increases the lipolytic effect of adrenalin (10(5) mol/1), there are no age differences.

The half-life of the activity was about 8 hr. The binding ability for 3'-GMP was lost simultaneously. Changes were detected only in histidine and the amino-terminal alanine residues upon amino acid analyses of the inactivated protein and its chymotryptic peptides. The inactivation occurred almost in parallel with the loss of two histidine residues in the enzyme. The pH dependences of the rate of inactivation and that of loss of histidine residues were similar and indicated the implication of a histidine residue or residues with pKa 7.5 to 8 in this reaction. 3'-GMP and guanosine showed some protective effect against loss of activity and of histidine residues. The reactivity of histidine residues was also reduced by prior modification of glutamic acid-58 with iodoacetate, of lysine-41 with maleic or cis-aconitic anhydride or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonate or of arginine-77 with ninhydrin. 2. Analyses of the chymotryptic peptides from oxidized samples of the iodoacetamide-inactivated enzyme showed that histidine-92 and histidine-40 reacted with iodoacetamide most rapidly and at similar rates, whereas histidine-27 was least reactive. Alkylation of histidine-92 was markedly slowed down when the Glu58-carboxymethylated enzyme was treated with iodoacetamide. On the other hand, alkylation of histidine-40 was slowed down most in the presence of 3'-GMP. These results suggest that histidine-92 and histidine-40 are involved in the catalytic action, probably forming part of the catalytic site and part of the binding site, respectively, and that histidine-27 is partially buried in the enzyme molecule or interacts strongly with some other residue, thus becoming relatively unreactive.", "pmid": "14120", "mesh_set": "D000409 D000596 D001665 D002918 D006150 D006639 D006863 D007460 D007461 D008745 D010455 D006163 D012260", "score": 13.601627, "rank": 5221, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

(2) According to the model dealt with, typical relations are expected for the dependence of the kinetic parameters of the translocation process upon the concentration of a polyvalent cation, differing essentially from those derived for the case in which the membrane carries no excess charge. (3) Even when a polyvalent cation does not compete with the substrate cation for binding to the translocation sites, apparently competitive inhibition may occur when the membrane is negatively charged. (4) The model is tested experimentally by studying the effects of the polyvalent cations Mg2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, Ba2+ and Al3+ upon Rb+ uptake into yeast cells at pH 4.5 A good applicability is found. (5) Equimolar concentrations of polyvalent cations reduce the rate of the Rb+ uptake into yeast cells in the order Mg2+ less than Sr2+ less than Ca2+ less than Ba2+ less than Al3+. (6) The conclusion is reached that the reduction in the rate of Rb+ uptake caused by the polyvalent cations applied results mainly from screening of the negative fixed charges on the membrane surface and binding to these negative sites rather than competition with Rb+ for the transport sites.

Benzamidine at concentrations greater than 10 mM has been shown to inhibit the conversion of proacrosin to acrosin. Based on this inhibition, a procedure was developed for extracting and quantitating the proacrosin content of bull sperm. Sperm were isolated from semen and washed by centrifugation through 1.3 M sucrose and the outer acrosomal membrane removed by homogenization. When 25 mM benzamidine was added to the semen and wash solutions, 98% or more of the acrosin activity in the sperm homogenate was present as proacrosin. Proacrosin can be extracted from the sperm homogenate by dialysis at pH 3, which solubilized the proenzyme and removed benzamidine. Benzamidine has been useful in isolating proacrosin and provides a new method for studying the activation of proacrosin in intact sperm. Neutralization of sperm extracts, after removal of benzamidine, resulted in rapid activation of proacrosin with a pH optimum of 8.5, and activation was complete within 15 min over a pH range of 7.0 to 9.5. Rapid activation also occurred during the washing of sperm in the absence of benzamidine, and this activation correlated with a swelling of the acrosomal membrane. This rapid activation appears to result from a small amount of acrosin activity consistently present in the sperm extract.

Aldehydes decrease the respiratory rate of mitochondria, as well as mitochondrial swelling induced by phosphate, by Ca2+ or by K+ plus valinomycin. They also partially inhibit cytochrome P-450. When injected into normal rats, aldehydes produce a decrease in the mitotic index of bone marrow cells and of the epithelial lining of the small intestine. A decrease in mitotic index and in cellularity is seen after injecting aldehydes into the peritoneal cavity of rats bearing transplanted ascites AH-130 Yoshida hepatoma. Aldehydes also impair the function of liver cell ligandin and potentiate the increase in cell permeability induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). The meaning of these results is discussed with special reference to the pathogenesis of cellular lesions in carbon tetrachloride poisoning.", "pmid": "259501", "mesh_set": "D000447 D000818 D002199 D005982 D008099 D008114 D008247 D008297 D008862 D008930 D008938 D014176 D011765 D051381 D014404", "score": 20.948069, "rank": 1921, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Cell lines studied included LA-N-1, LA-N-2, IMR-32, SK-N-SH, and SK-N-MC. Veratridine-dependent uptake of 22Na+ implied the presence of the action potential Na+ ionophore in LA-N-1, LA-N-2, IMR-32, and SK-N-SH. The time course of 22Na+ uptake and inhibition of uptake by tetrodotoxin supported this. SK-N-MC had no veratridine-dependent 22Na+ uptake. Tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.10.), glutamic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15), and acetylcholine contents in neuroblastoma cells were compared to those in brain. LA-N-1 and IMR-32 contained 15 and 5 times as much tyrosine hydroxylase, respectively, whereas LA-N-2, SK-N-SH, and SK-N-MC contained only 0.5 to 5% of that in brain. Acetylcholine was present in -LA-N-2 in 15- to 20-fold greater quantities than in brain; other lines had only 10 to 50% of that in brain. None of the cell lines contained glutamic acid decarboxylase. Thus, continuously propogated human neuroblastoma cell lines may have the action potential Na+ ionophore and may be adrenergic (LA-N-1 and IMR-32), cholinergic (LA-N-2), or inactive (SK-N-SH and SK-N-MC).

{"title": "Effect of dichloroacetate on gluconeogenesis in isolated rat hepatocytes.", "abstract": "The effect of dichloroacetate on rates of gluconeogenesis was studied in isolated parenchymal cells obtained from the livers of normal fasted rats. Dichloroacetate significantly inhibited glucose formation from endogenous substrates and from added precursors (e.g., lactate, pyruvate, or glycerate) which enter the gluconeogenic pathway prior to the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH). In contrast, dichloroacetate did not significantly affect glucose synthesis from precursors (e.g., fructose, or glycerol) which enter beyond the GPDH-catalyzed step. Lactate production from fructose of glycerol was unaffected by dichloroacetate. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis occurred regardless of the apparent effects of dichloroacetate on the redox state of the cytosol. Dichloroacetate produced variable effects on the lactate-pyruvate substate pair, while it consistently produced a more oxidized state in the beta-hydroxybutyrate--acetoacetate couple. Unlike uncoupling agents, dichloroacetate reduced glucose synthesis without stimulating respiration or altering total adenine nucleotide levels or ATP/ADP ratios. Dichloroacetate did not affect the metabolism of lactate or pyruvate to CO2 or glycogen. It did, however, significantly inhibit conversion by the cells of added lactate to pyruvate and glucose or of added pyruvate to lactate and glucose.", "pmid": "834145", "mesh_set": "D000085 D000227 D000818 D004305 D005943 D007657 D007773 D008099 D008112 D008297 D010101 D011773 D000644 D051381", "score": 17.421139, "rank": 3341, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

After water deprivation, the iguana promptly drank slightly more than enough water to restore the body fluids to isotonicity even under conditions of hypervolaemia. 2. In response to systemic injections of hypertonic solutions of NaCl and sucrose, the iguana drank and retained enough water to dilute the injected load to isotonicity irrespective of whether water was offered immediately or after 3 hr, and irrespective of whether the solute was administered I.V. or I.P. 3. Hypertonic solutions to glucose, urea, sorbitol and KCl caused little drinking. 4. The long latencies to drinking after hypertonic loads, which were not dependent on the nature of the solute, the route of administration or the dosage, were shown not to be a result of slow distribution of the solute throughout the body fluids. 5. Clearance of injected solutes via renal and extra-renal (nasal salt gland) routes was negligible during the 6 hr experimental period. 6. Measurements of plasma [Na], haematocrit, osmotic pressure and inulin space showed that the iguana drank, in response to cellular dehydration, enough water to restore the intracellular fluid volume to normal. 7. We conclude that, in response to substances which dehydrate cells, the iguana regulates its body osmolality precisely and efficiently provided it is able to do so by drinking. In this respect the responses of the iguana are similar to those of the nephrectomized rat since, in the short term, both rely exclusively on drinking to restore cellular water to normal. 8.

Separation and measurement.", "abstract": "A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension. After rat kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical cell suspensions were obtained. Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel filtered on Sephadex G-25. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate buffer. Subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors, bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned. Calculated yields were about 70% of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell homogenates. Recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged from 83-108% (mean 96%). Using this technique, it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from 0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2) alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe) esterase units per 10(8) cells.

The pH optimum of the reaction is 4.5--4.8. Under similar incubation conditions, a complex is formed between activator and sulphatides which is partially inhibited, due to competitive binding in the presence of cerebrosides of phosphatidylserine. Inhibition depends upon the concentration of the lipids and is of the same order of magnitude as the inhibition (by these lipids) of enzymic sulphatide hydrolysis in the presence of activator. Complex formation between activator and sulphatides is reversible since the complex dissociates partially when certain concentrations of phosphatidylserine are added. Moreover, the rate of sulphatide hydrolysis increases with the concentration of the activator.sulphatide complex in the reaction mixture.

In this study, cDNA and genomic DNA encoding \u03b1-galactosidase gene alleles from a normal and two curd coconuts were successfully cloned and characterized. The deduced amino acid of wild type \u03b1-galactosidase contains 398 amino acid residues with a 17\u202fN-terminal amino acids signal peptide sequence. Three mutant alleles, the first 19-amino acids from 67 to 85 (ADALVSTGLARLGYQYVNL) deletion with S137R and the second R216T, were identified from curd coconut plant no.1 while the third P250R was identified from curd coconut plant no. 10. All mutations of \u03b1-galactosidase gene were confirmed by the analysis of parental genomic DNA from normal and curd coconuts. Heterologous expression in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) indicated that recombinant P250R, R216T and 19-amino acids deletion-S137R mutant proteins showed no \u03b1-galactosidase activity. Only the recombinant wild-type protein was able to detect for \u03b1-galactosidase activity.

Infusion of acid-saline vehicle alone had no significant effect on plasma GH or cortisol (P less than 0.05). L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa) (4.5 and 45 mg/kg), but not apomorphine (7 mug/kg), a specific dopaminergic agonist, produced significant elevations of GH. Both noradrenergic (clonidine HCl, 1.5, 15, and 150 mug/kg, and D,L-threodihydroxyphenylserine (D,L-threodops) 90 mg/kg) and serotoninergic (5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP), 45 mg/kg) agonists induced significant GH responses. These findings suggest that GH is regulated in the rhesus monkey by noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurons, whereas participation of dopaminergic neurons has not been established. Significant cortisol responses were only observed following infusion of 5HTP (45 mg/kg).

In the absence of added calcium ions, virtually no enzyme activity could be detected. An increase in concentration of the cation to about 0.5 mM, however, turned on the enzyme to appreciable levels of activity. Simultaneously, Ca2+ produced formation of high molecular weight, nondisulfied bonded protein polymers either directly in the lysate or in fresh cells when the cation was added together with the A23187 ionophore. The polymers could be readily identified in the isolated cell ghosts by means of disc gel electrophoresis. If the Ca2+-promoted formation of polymers was allowed to take place in the presence of 14C-putrescine, then this tracer became incorporated into the polymeric material. The incorporation indicated that polymerization occurred through gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine bridtes. It is suggested that the intrinsic transamidase mediates protein crosslinking of the erythrocyte membrane whenever there is an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The presence of suitable transglutaminase substrates, e.g. histamine, inhibited crosslinking when the cells were incubated with Ca2+ and ionophore.", "pmid": "12508", "mesh_set": "D002118 D004789 D004905 D004910 D004912 D006801 D008565 D011700 D005723", "score": 16.793156, "rank": 3682, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

At lower pH, 6.8-7.2, the rate of orthophosphate uptake increases and exceeds the rate of labeling of ATP. These data are explained by the existence of a primary system for ATP uptake which involves the mediation of membrane-bound glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

The effects of pH and various concentrations of substrates, Mg2+, K+ and modifiers were studied. In the absence of fructose 1, 6-diphosphate at pH 7.3, the phosphorylated pyruvate kinase appeared to have a lower affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate (K0.5=0.8 mM) than the unphosphorylated enzyme (K0.5=0.3 mM). The enzyme activity vs. phosphoenolpyruvate concentration curve was more sigmoidal for the phosphorylated enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 2.6 compared to 1.6 for the unphosphorylated enzyme. Fructose 1, 6-diphosphate increased the apparent affinity of both enzyme forms for phosphoenolpyruvate. At saturating concentrations of this activator, the kinetics of both enzyme forms were transformed to approximately the same hyperbolic curve, with a Hill coefficient of 1.0 and K0.5 of about 0.04 mM for phosphoenolpyruvate. The apparent affinity of the enzyme for fructose 1, 6-diphosphate was high at 0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate with a K0.5=0.06 muM for the unphosphorylated pyruvate kinase and 0.13 muM for the phosphorylated enzyme. However, in the presence of 0.5 mM alanine plus 1.5 mM ATP, a higher fructose 1, 6-diphosphate concentration was needed for activation, with K0.5 of 0.4 muM for the unphosphorylated enzyme and of 1.4 muM for the phosphorylated enzyme.

We carried out a retrospective study of these cases and the prospective conditions, which might be related to POPF, were examined with univariate and multivariate analysis.

It reacts to alterations of the external calcium concentration with an immediate adaptation of contractile force. 2. In mammalian heart there is a network of large transverse tubules throughout the cell. These structures are regularly arranged at the level of the sarcomeric Z- and I-lines and increase the cell surface by a factor of ten. 3. Experimental evidence favours the assumption that the plasmalemma could be the site of a loosely bound superficial Ca fraction which becomes ionized upon depolarization and is again bound upon repolarization of the cardiac cell membrane. 4. A mechanism is discussed which bases the excitation-contraction coupling process on a physicochemical interaction of calcium with membrane phospholipids. The degree of interaction is thought to be governed by the transmembrane electric field, the induced dipole moment of membrane constituents, and proton activity within the membrane.", "pmid": "18310", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001001 D002118 D002462 D004285 D006321 D006863 D066298 D007700 D008564 D009132 D009206 D010718 D051381", "score": 13.097954, "rank": 5426, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The results with putrescine on ethylmorphine metabolism were less dramatic, and no effect could be observed with putrescine in studies with other drug substrates. In contrast to the enhancing effects, inhibition was observed when spermine or spermidine was added to p-nitroanisole O-demethylation assay mixtures, and no effect was observed in assays for acetanilide hydroxylation. The inhibiting and enhancing effects of the polyamines can be observed in assays containing liver preparations from both male and female rats, and those from rats pretreated with phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene.

Potassium-sodium tissue homeostasis in the myocardium proved to be stable under these conditions. Glucocorticoid hypercorticism was characterized by a reduction of creatinphosphate and by the accumulation of inorganic phosphate.

The apparent K(m) for HCO(3) (-) at pH7.8 was 400mm without acetyl-CoA, and 16mm with a saturating activator concentration. The relationship between reciprocal initial rate and reciprocal MgATP(2-) concentration was non-linear (convex-down) in the absence of acetyl-CoA, but the extent of deviation decreased as the activator concentration was increased. The relationship between reciprocal initial rate and reciprocal pyruvate concentration was non-linear (convex-down) in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA. 2. The optimum pH for catalysis of oxaloacetate synthesis was similar in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA. The variation with pH of apparent K(m) for HCO(3) (-) implicated residue(s) with pK(a) 8.6 in catalysis of the activator-independent oxaloacetate synthesis. 3. Linear Arrhenius and van't Hoff plots were observed for the temperature-dependence of oxaloacetate synthesis in the absence of acetyl-CoA over the range 25-55 degrees C. E(a) (activation energy) was 56.3kJ/mol and DeltaH(double dagger) (HCO(3) (-)) (enthalpy of activation) was -38.6kJ/mol.

E(a) was 43.7 and 106.3kJ/mol above and below 30 degrees C respectively. 4. Incubation of Bacillus pyruvate carboxylase with trinitrobenzenesulphonate caused specific inactivation of acetyl-CoA-dependent catalytic activity associated with the incorporation of 1.3+/-0.2 trinitrophenyl residues per subunit.

An attempt to explain the mechanism of this effect is now described. L-DOPA (50-200 mg/kg, s.c.) was unable to restore brain or heart noradrenaline levels in pyrazole pre-treated rats. After monoamine oxidase inhibition with tranylcypromine or pargyline there was a slight increase in brain NA in these rats but no further increase was observed in response to L-DOPA (30 mg/kg). Brain dopamine levels were relatively higher in pyrazole pre-treated rats. This difference was particularly clear in the hypothalamus but not present at all in striatum. It was impossible to duplicate the above results using nialamide as the monoamine oxidase inhibitor. After depletion of monoamine stores by reserpine (2 x 2 mg/kg) or oxypertine (75 mg/kg) and treatment with tranylcypromine and L-DOPA it is possible to get an indication of the maximal rate of synthesis of NA. In pyrazole treated rats synthesis of NA in brain was 70% reduced and about 50% reduced in heart. Synthesis of dopamine from L-DOPA was unimpaired. Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity in the hypothalamus of rats treated for four days with pyrazole (100 mg/kg i.p.) was more than 40% reduced. This inhibition could not be obtained by addition of pyrazole to samples of purified dopamine-beta-hydroxylase.

After continuous intravenous infusion, a constant ara-C level is achieved slowly in the plasma. Unless a loading (priming) dose is administered immediately before beginning the infusion, a steady-state ara-C level cannot be achieved until 8 to 24 hr after the infusion. The infusion system has two mechanisms--one for giving a loading dose (3 ml/min) and the other for regular infusion at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0 ml/hr. If a loading dose is given before continuous infusion, a steady-state are-C level is achieved within an hour. The plasma ara-C disappearance curves are biphasic with a terminal half-life of 104 min, which is the same as that of a single injection. The cumulative urinary excretion after approximately 23 hr of infusion varied from 14% to 35% in different patients; more than 90% is ara-U and the remainder is ara-C.

Although the patients with diminished activity could not be distinguished by means of formal personality test, questionnaires completed by their wives suggested that they were less willing to assume responsibility, had increased difficulty in adjusting to life at home and at work and were more neurotic and depressed than those with normal or increased activity. Furthermore, those with decreased sexual activity had a poorer response to training in terms of attendance, final average jogging distance and gains in physiologic status. Since the frequency of angina and ventricular premature beats was less during intercourse than during standard laboratory exercise, it was concluded that normal sexual relations carry no special risk for the average postcoronary patient; indeed, by enhancing self-esteem and encouraging effective participation in an exercise programm, acceptance of normal sexual activity may improve the prognosis.", "pmid": "861882", "mesh_set": "D001794 D005081 D006339 D006801 D008297 D009203 D010101 D005082 D011581 D012725", "score": 17.356344, "rank": 3374, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The greatest difference in intestinal mass occurs in the proximal bowel and is thought to occur because of rapid absorption in the proximal small bowel. This study was designed to determine the effects of the individual components of the elemental diet and their site of administration within the small bowel on small intestinal mass. Rats were maintained on intravenous alimentation and the proximal gut (by intragastric infusion) or the ileum was continuously infused with equal volumes of 30% dextrose, 5% dextrose, 5% amino acids, saline, or 30% mannitol. After 1 week of combined intravenous alimentation and gut infusion, the rats were killed and parameters of small intestinal epithelial mass were determined sequentially for the entire bowel. Although saline- and mannitol-infused controls did not differ from uninfused intravenously fed rats, proximal infusion of 30% dextrose reproduced the effects of a complete elemental diet. Proximal infusion of amino acids but not 5% dextrose had a limited effect on the duodenum and jejunum. Ileal infusion of 30% dextrose led to local hyperplasia of the site of infusion and in addition produced hyperplasia of the proximal gut. Ileal amino acid infusion, but not 5% dextrose infusion, led to local ileal hyperplasia. We conclude that: (1) intraluminal dextrose and amino acids have direct effects in maintaining gut mass (2) the gut is more responsive to amino acids compared to 5% dextrose, and (3) ileal 30% dextrose infusion leads to remote effects in the proximal gut, perhaps mediated by hormonal or neurovascular factors.", "pmid": "838226", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D001835 D004247 D004847 D005755 D005947 D007082 D007263 D007413 D007421 D007583 D008297 D009747 D009929 D011506 D051381 D013270", "score": 23.637741, "rank": 1263, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

[3H]Dihydroazapetine retains significant ability to block alpha-adrenoreceptors and has been used as a ligand to study the receptor in a subcellular fraction containing membrane fragments from rat vas deferens. Specific binding of [3H]dihydroazapetine rapidly reaches equilibrium and is also reversible and saturable with a dissociation constant similar to that determined pharmacologically. The binding capacity is approximately 40 pmol/mg of protein. All alpha-adrenergic blockers tested were able to inhibit specific binding. High concentrations of alprenolol, atropine, or chlorpheniramine had no effect. In addition, all alpha-adrenergic agonists of the imidazoline class inhibit binding in low concentrations, whereas soterenol or carbamylcholine did not. There is good correlation (r=0.84) between blockade or stimulation of the receptor in intact tissues and inhibition of binding of [3H]dihydroazapetine to the subcellular fraction. These findings suggest that the fraction contains alpha-adrenoreceptor-related proteins.

At these low albumin concentrations, in the absence of NADPH, the beta-ketostearoyl-coA was converted back to palmitate. This cleavage reaction is inhibited by albumin in a concentration-dependent manner. When the palmitoyl-CoA to albumin molar ratio was less than 2 : 1, the specific activity for condensation exceeded that for overall chain elongation and some beta-ketostearate was shown to accumulate under chain elongation conditions. The specific activity for dehydration of beta-hydroxystearoyl-CoA was maximal when the acyl-CoA to albumin molar ratio was between 10 : 1 and 4 : 1 but the rate of this reaction was not markedly influenced by variations in albumin concentration. The specific activity for the NADPH-dependent reduction of 2-trans-octa-decenoyl-CoA was 18 nmol . min(-1) . mg(-1) in the absence of albumin and increased to a maximum of 112 when the substrate to albumin molar ratio was 2 : 1.

Conversely, the specific activity for the reverse dehydrase was maximal at low albumin concentrations and the rate of this reaction declined as the albumin concentration increased.

The Mg2+ optimum occurred at 0.66 mM in the absence of NH4+ while the NH4+ optimum occurred at 100 mM in the absence of Mg2+. Analysis of the bases methylated in (E. coli B) tRNA by extracts of P. aurelia showed the presence of 1-methyladenine, 1-methylguanine, N2-methylguanine, N2,N2-dimethylguanine and methylated pyrimidine nucleotides. In comparison, an analysis of the in vivo methylation of tRNA from P. aurelia showed the presence of 1-methyladenine, 6-methyladenine, 6,6-dimethyladenine, 1-methylguanine, N2-methylguanine, N2,N2-dimethylguanine, 7-methylguanine, and methylated pyrimidine nucleotides.

The internal regulation of mast cell-dependent phenomenons occurs at at least four levels: 1) the intensity and nature of the activating stimulus, 2) the regulation of mediator generation and release of cellular levels of the cyclic nucleotides, 3) the capacity of target cells to bind and respond to primary mediators, and 4) the rate at which mediators undergo biodegradation. Inasmuch as the mast cell is present at cutaneous and mucosal surfaces about venules, it seems likely that the initial or humoral phase of its response achieves an influx of plasms proteins, such as immunoglobulins and complement components, whereas the subsequent cellular phase augments local host defense through the entrance of neutrophils and eosinophils that terminate the humoral phase.

The isomer of alpha-methylisocitrate formed from alpha-methyl-cis-aconitate (cis-2-butane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate) by aconitase inhibits TPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase and has been identified as D-threo-alpha-methylisocitrate (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylate) by optical rotation and circular dichroism studies. Mitochondrial bovine heart aconitase catalyzes a reversible reaction between D-threo-alpha-methylisocitrate (Km, 0.2 mM) and alpha-methyl-cis-aconitate (Km, 0.05 mM) at pH 7.4. However, formation of methylcitrate (2-hydroxy-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylate) from these substrates or utilization of synthetic methylcitrate for formation of these products could not be demonstrated with bovine heart aconitase.

The enzyme was found to be stable to storage and active at two pH optima. Alcohol in the reaction mixture produced a net effect of slowing the rate of aspirin hydrolysis; this was attributable to a marked inhibitory effect on aspirin esterase activity which was not completely counteracted by the increased rate of spontaneous breakdown of aspirin by alcohol. Age, sex, or gastric disease state of the patient from whom the tissue was obtained, did not significantly alter the level of enzyme activity measured, nor were different levels obtained from body or antral mucosa. In patients with gastric ulcer, those with a previous history of regular aspirin consumption did not show significantly different levels from those without such a history.

An investigation of the non-stimulated secretion of some of the hormones influencing metabolism was undertaken by evaluating thyroxine, iodothyronine binding index, testosterone, growth hormone, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone in venous blood of fasting healthy subjects and quadriplegic patients. The effect of the duration of the paralysis was examined by repeating the evaluations at different periods after onset. The results show that 1) thyroxine was low for 2 months after onset in 21 patients and normal thereafter in 53 patients, 2) testosterone was low throughout the study in 62 patients; the decrease is greatest during the first 2 months, 3) growth hormone was often increased in 46 patients for 8 months after onset, and nearly normal afterward in 25 patients, 4) calcitonin was normal in 22 patients throughout the study, and 5) parathyroid hormone was normal in relation to normal serum calcium as early as 6 days after onset in 79 out of 83 patients. These data do not preclude a parathyroid hormone increase at onset or alterations in the patterns of circadian secretion and in the responses to specific stimulation for the hormones evaluated. Therefore, it may be concluded only that the steady state secretion of these hormones is not altered by traumatic quadriplegia per se, but is temporarily modified by the original insult to the nervous system, and by changes in life pattern and the heavy sedation that follows.

Growth hormone (rGH) profiles from rats with complete hypothalamic deafferentation (CC) showed persistence of episodic rGH secretion with greatly increased frequency and elevated trough values, but without apparent entrainment to the light-dark cycle. Anterior (AC) and posterior (PC) deafferentation had no effect on the normal 3 h periodicity of rGH secretory episodes, but light-dark entrainment was lost in AC rats. Prolactin (rPRL) secretion in CC rats remained at normal low baseline levels without secretory episodes, while in AC and PC rats, as in normal rats, bursts of rPRL secretion occurred, often temporally related to rGH bursts. Thyrotropin (rTSH) levels in CC rats were less variable, and lower than in normal rats, while rTSH secretory profiles appeared normal in AC and PC rats. These results suggest that the isolated medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) contains neural substrates for episodic rGH secretion, and to a lesser extent, for rTSH. It is hypothesized that excessive rGH secretion in CC rats results from surgery damaging the rhythmicity of the rGH releasing factor (GRF) michanism, so that both sustained secretion and more frequent bursts of GRF occur. An effective rPRL inhibitory mechanism remains intact within complete hypothalamic deafferentations, while episodic rPRL and rTSH secretion require intact lateral afferents to the MBH.

They have few microvilli and no basal labyrinth and are placed between digestive cells only as single cells (1-2 per cross section of a midgut). (2) After the first bloodmeal some ultrastructural changes occur in the midgut of all fleas. These changes are interpreted as a structural reflection of metabolic processes such as secretion of digestive enzymes, resorption, storage and transport of digested nutrients, and synthesis of digestive enzymes. (3) More conspicious changes occur in the midgut of the stationary parasitic and maturing females of E. gallinacea and T. penetrans. The nuclear volumes of the digestive cells reach the two-fold and eight-fold value, respectively. The nucleus/cytoplasm ratio decreases by half. The corresponding cytoplasmic growth of each cell is reflected in an enlargement of the whole midgut. The digestive cells form long apical cell extensions. The nucleus, basal labyrinth, rer, and golgi complex all change their morphology, and this can be interpreted as the result of a higher level of metabolic activity than during the first bloodmeal. (4) The midgut of the oviparous female of T. penetrans undergoes a process of compensatory hypertrophy which consists in the cellular hypertrophy of each digestive cell and in an extensive proliferation of the regenerative cells. A unique structure, called 'nuclear halo' appears within the process of cellular hypertrophy. This structure consists of a layer of 70-100 A thick filaments along the periphery of the nucleus. The nuclear halo contains few ribosomes and is screened from the cytoplasm by an rer cisterna. The filaments may contain RNA molecules which are on their way to the cytoplasm. It has been demonstrated that the structure of the midgut epithelium is influenced by the nutritive and parasitic behavior of the flea. The stationary and oviparous E. gallinacea and T. penetrans reveal an extensive and irreversible change of their midgut epithelium.", "pmid": "8972", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001769 D004847 D004848 D005247 D005260 D008297 D005423 D014617", "score": 10.733783, "rank": 5981, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Plasma albumin concentrations were significantly lower in the experimental animals when compared to controls at 8, 12 and 20 d but plasma volumes (ml/kg body-weight) tended to be greater in the former animals. Total vascular albumin mass (g/kg body-weight) was significantly less in experimental animals compared to controls at 8 and 20 d, but was significantly reduced below values at 0 d only at 20 d. 3. extravascular albumin mass (g/kg body-weight) was significantly lower in experimental animals in comparison with controls at 2, 5, 8, 12 and 20 d and significantly reduced below values at 0 d at 5, 8, 12, and 20 d. 4. Whole-body albumin mass was significantly reduced at 5, 8, 12 and 20 d when compared both with controls killed at the same time and animals killed at 0 d. Measurement of the ratio, extravascular albumin mass: vascular albumin mass indicated a significant redistribution of whole-body albumin mass at 5 and 20 d and mean values for this ratio were always lower in experimental animals than in controls. 5.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen (CMRO2), glucose (CMRGL), and lactate (CMRL act), and various cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters were measured before and 2 h after the treatment. Pre-OHP and post-OHP average values of arterial blood and CSF lactate, and CMRL act were higher than normal, while CBF, CMRO2 and CSF oxygen pressure (PO2) were lower. CBF tended to increase after OHP in some patients and to decrease in others. This discrepancy and the conflicting results of the literature can be tentatively explained in assuming that there is a different effect of OHP on normal brain circulation as compared to impaired brain circulation. Changes of cerebral metabolic rates were inconsistent and did not relate to changes of CBF, except with repeated studies of the same patient. A correlation was found between the variations of CMRGL and those of arterial blood and CSF glucose content.

Systemic arterial pressures were measured in anesthetized animals via carotid catheters and microvascular pressures were measured in mesenteric arterioles by a micropipette servo-null system. Systemic arterial pressures in the 1-G and 2-G groups were not significantly different from each other, but both were considerably higher than those reported for normal rats. In the microcirculation, pressures in the terminal arterioles (20 to 35 micron) were significantly higher in the 2-G animals, but pressures at the level of the smaller (10 to 15 micron) precapillary arterioles were not significantly different between the two groups. The pressure responses to intravenous infusion of norepinephrine were also compared in the two groups and found to be significantly less in the 2-G animals.

The changes in aldosterone could not be explained on the basis of changes in the plasma concentrations of potassium or sodium. The renal sodium excretion was inversely related to the values for aldosterone both before and after beta adrenergic blockade, indicating a major role for aldosterone in regulating sodium excretion. A number of patients had an abnormal intrarenal distribution of plasma flow with a relative hypoperfusion of the renin-secreting outer cortical nephrons. Plasma renin activity was inversely related to outer cortical plasma flow, suggesting that the reduced outer cortical flow may be a stimulus to increased renin secretion.

Rams made cryptorchid at 6 weeks of age had increased serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) when determined at 9 months of age. These levels approached those of the castrate animal; and yet serum levels of testosterone (T) were unchanged. Even though mean serum LH concentrations were elevated sixfold to eightfold over those of intact ram levels, a temporal relationship between this hormone and T was observed similar to that reported in the intact ram. Intramuscular injections of dihydrotestosterone had no effect on circulating levels of LH or FSH in either cryptorchid or castrate rams, whereas T effectively reduced these gonadotropins in castrate but not in cryptorchid rams. Only estradiol-17beta (E2) was effective in both cryptorchid and castrate rams. Estradiol was a potent inhibitor of LH secretion; however, its effect on FSH levels was less dramatic. This suggests that testicular products other than E2 may be important in the regulation of FSH production and/or release. Importantly, the inhibition of LH secretion lasted less than 12 h; whereas, the negative effects of E2 on FSH secretion lasted 72 to 144 h.

{"title": "Effects of sulfinpyrazone on platelet prostaglandin synthesis and platelet release of serotonin.", "abstract": "Sulfinpyrazone added to PRP inhibited the release of serotonin induced by collagen. The inhibitory effect depended strongly on the strength of the collagen stimulus. Serotonin release was also inhibited (up to 73%) in PRP prepared from subjects who had ingested the drug. This is the first demonstration of a direct effect of a sulfinpyrazone in vivo on in vitro tests of platelet function. Prostaglandin synthesis was studied with lysates of washed platelets, arachidonic acid-14C, and silicic acid chromatography to isolate a reaction product which was tentatively identified as thromboxane B2. Platelet prostaglandin synthesis was shown to be strongly inhibited by sulfinpyrazone. Inhibition was competitive with respect to substrate. It is proposed that effects of sulfinpyrazone on platelet function may be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The competitive nature of sulfinpyrazone inhibition may explain why sulfinpyrazone is a strong inhibitor of the release reaction under conditions of dilute collagent stimulation but is weak in the presence of stronger stimuli. In comparing the potency of inhibitors of platelet prostaglandin synthesis the nature of inhibition must be considered.

{"title": "The pharmacology of adrenergic neuronal responses in the cerebral cortex: evidence for excitatory alpha- and inhibitory beta-receptors.", "abstract": "1. The technique of microelectrophoresis was used to compare the actions of a range of adrenoceptor agonists on single cortical neurones in the rat anaesthetized with halothane. 2. Phenylephrine and methoxamine were exclusively excitatory, whereas salbutamol was entirely depressant. Noradrenaline and isoprenaline could evoke both excitatory and depressant responses. Lower doses of isoprenaline usually evoked depressions, whereas higher doses, on the same cell, evoked excitatory responses. 3. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, reversibly antagonized excitatory responses to adrenoceptor agonists, without affecting depressant responses to adrenoceptor agonists or excitatory responses to acetylcholine. 4. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, propranolol and sotalol, reversibly antagonized both depressant and excitatory responses to adrenoceptor agonists, without affecting responses to acetylcholine. When the effect of sotalol on excitatory and depressant responses to adrenoceptor agonists was compared on the same cell, the depressant responses could be selectively antagonized, without affecting the excitatory responses. 5. It is concluded that (a) responses of cortical neurones to adrenoceptor agonists are mediated by both alpha- and beta-receptors; (b) these alpha- and beta-receptors give rise to opposite effects: the alpha-receptors being excitatory and the beta-receptors being inhibitory; and (c) responses of many neurones reflect the presence of both types of receptor.", "pmid": "15697", "mesh_set": "D000316 D000317 D000318 D000319 D000818 D002540 D004594 D008297 D009474 D051381 D011941 D011942 D011943 D013564", "score": 18.329082, "rank": 2911, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Epithelial cells isolated from the small  intestine of Wistar rats fed a stock diet showed 24% to 57% higher transport of 1 mM leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine, phenylalanine tryptophan and histidine in the presence of 10 mM fructose than in its absence. In contrast, 10mM glucose generally inhibited the transport of these amino acids and 10mM sorbose had no effect on leucine transport. Fructose failed to consistently stimulate the transport of basic amino acids and generally inhibited the transport of glucose and galactose, indicating that the stimulation was relatively specific for neutral amino acids. Cells preloaded with fructose optimally stimulated leucine transport in the absence of extracellular fructose. Ouabain and dinitrophenol inhibited the stimulation of leucine transport by intracellular fructose after 2 minutes. A stimulation mediated by an exchange transport mechanism was rejected on  the basis of the failure of 1 mM neutral amino acids either  to inhibit the transport of 10 mM fructose or to accelerate the movement of fructose out of fructose-loaded cells. Although the mechanism remains unknown, these results demonstrate a specific effect of fructose at the intestinal level that produces a stimulation of neutral amino acid transport.", "pmid": "16101", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D001693 D004847 D004848 D005632 D005947 D006863 D007413 D007421 D008297 D051381 D013395", "score": 28.815573, "rank": 573, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The enzyme activity was measured as the release of [3H]oleic acid from a serum-activated, triglyceride emulsion, in which [3H]trioleate was used as trace substance. The enzyme activity studied had the characteristic properties of lipoprotein-lipase activity, i.e. it was activated by the addition of serum or apolipoprotein C-II and inhibited in the presence of high ionic strength, protamine sulphate or apolipoprotein C-III. A mean Km of 0.40 +/- 0.13 (S.D.) mmol/l for triglyceride substrate was found in tissue samples that had very different concentrations of lipoprotein-lipase activity. This Km was similar to the low fasting concentrations of very low density lipoprotein triglycerides often found in healthy individuals.

In order to dissociate mechanical and metabolic factors, the effect of hypermetabolism on hypoxic ventilatory response was evaluated at rest. Carbohydrate and protein feeding increases metabolic rate, and their effects on chemosensitivity, ventilation, and blood pH were evaluated in six normal subjects 2 h and 3 h after calorically equal test meals (1,000 cal). After carbohydrate, base-line oxygen consumption (Vo(2)) increased from 237+/-11.3 ml/min (SEM) to 302+/-19.4 (P < 0.001) and 303+/-18.5 (P < 0.001) at 2 h and 3 h, respectively.

{"title": "Afterdischarge on postganglionic sympathetic nerves following repetitive stimulation of the preganglionic nerve to the rat superior cervical ganglion in vitro.", "abstract": "An asynchronous firing or afterdischarge (AD) was recorded in vitro from the postganglionic internal carotid nerve of the rat superior cervical ganglion following repetitive stimulation of the preganglionic nerve when ganglion transmission was blocked by chlorisondamine, nicotine or hexamethonium, but was rarely observed in untreated ganglia. A stimulus frequency of at least 5 Hz was required to induce AD and as few as 100 pulses caused a significant response. The amplitude and duration of AD varied with the number of pulses. Low calcium solutions resulted in AD in the absence of ganglion blocking drugs, and high calcium solutions or low concentrations of atropine abolished the AD. Increasing magnesium concentration to 10 mM or the manganese concentration to 0.1 mM reduced or prevented AD following preganglionic nerve stimulation. The onset of AD was delayed in potassium-free solutions and at a lowered temperature. Dinitrophenol had a small depressant effect on AD but sodium azide reduced the amplitude significantly. Exposure of ganglia to bethanechol, 300 to 600 muM, resulted in asynchronous firing recorded from postganglionic nerves, and stimulation of the preganglionic nerve transiently depressed the drug-induced firing but enhanced the firing 30 to 60 seconds after the volley. Physostigmine did not alter the amplitude of bethanechol-induced firing after a volley. Prolonged high frequency (40 Hz) stimulation of the preganglionic nerve increased the AD following a 20 Hz test volley for up to 1 hour. It is concluded that increasing the release of acetylcholine or blockade of nicotinic receptors makes more acetylcholine available for interaction with muscarinic receptors, and that stimulation of the preganglionic nerve unmasks or sensitizes ganglionic muscarinic receptors.

Adenine nucleotide exchange-transport was reconstituted in vesicles prepared from phospholipids and protein fractions derived from bovine heart submitochondrial particles. The transport, which was specific for ATP and ADP was measured either as ADP/ADP, ATP/ATP, or ADP/ATP exchange. The highest specific activity (370 nanomoles of ADP/ADP exchange/min/mg of protein at room temperature) was obtained with a protein fraction prepared by cholate extraction of partly resolved submitochondrial particles followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation. 2. At 200 muM external nucleotide, the exchange reactions were inhibited by low concentrations of bongkrekate, atractyloside, and palmitoyl-CoA, with Ki values of 1.8, 3.0, and 7.5 muM, respectively. The ADP/ADP nucleotide exchange was stimulated about 5-fold by 500 muM MgCl2 or MnCl2(km of 40 muM) and about 3-fold by 500 muM CaCl2(Km of 90 muM). It was optimal between pH 6.0 and 7.0 and decreased rapidly above pH 7.5. Arrhenius plots between 0 degrees and 40 degrees showed a break point at 15 degrees with soybean phospholipids and an activation energy of 29.5 kcal/mole from 0 degrees-15 degrees and 9.0 kcal/mole from 15 degrees-40 degrees. With mitochondrial phospholipids the break point was at 9 degrees and activation energies were 42.4 kcal/mole from 0 degrees-9 degrees and 7.6 kcal/mole from 9 degrees-40 degrees. 3. The phospholipid requirements for adenine nucleotide exchange were similar to those of oxidative phosphorylation. Optimal rates were observed with a phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine ratio of 4:1. Cardiolipin had a slight stimulatory effect. 4. The uptake of ADP into vesicles containing ATP was stimulated by KCl or by KPi as well as by hexafluoracetonylacetone, and uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation.

Because both muscles were inactive in the first 24 h, any difference in insulin sensitivity could be due only to some trophic influence of the distal nerve stump. Fifteen hours after either type of denervation, 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake was refractory to insulin. However, at 24 h, insulin sensitivity of distally denervated muscles (with or without a second ipsilateral proximal denervation) was normal, whereas that of proximally denervated muscles was still relatively insensitive.

Typically, in a 5-h incubation, 0.45 mM 32Pi reacts with 22 muM tubulin to form 3.3 muM [32P]GDP, and 0.3 muM [32P]GTP. The yield of labeled nucleotide is decreased as the result of a hydrolase activity associated with the preparation. The [32P]GTP is exclusively beta-labeled and is therefore formed by phosphorylation of [32P]GDP by a phosphate donor other than inorganic phosphate, most likely by nonradioactive GTP. Added GDP significantly decreases the yield of labeled GTP, but increases the yield of labeled GDP in a manner that is consistent with a partial protection against [32P]GDP hydrolysis, but not consistent with significant additional [32P]GDP formation. Added GMP is an inhibitor of both labeling activities associated with the preparation, although it has no effect on the hydrolase activity. Added ADP (0.4 MM) does not form labeled ADP or ATP and does not influence the labeling of GDP or GTP. The formation of [32P]GDP was shown to occur by an exchange mechanism rather than through net synthesis from GMP and Pi. These results provide evidence for a reversible guanidylation of the protein. The labeling activity is always specifically associated with highly purified tubulin preparations. Microtubular protein preparations are found to catalyze an exchange of oxygen from H218O into inorganic phosphate. Thus, there are two distinct catalytic properties associated with tubulin.", "pmid": "845163", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001665 D001921 D006023 D006150 D006160 D008870 D011485 D013552 D014404", "score": 13.133792, "rank": 5407, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Reaction product, which forms when cerous ions react with H2O2 to form an electron-dense precipitate, was demonstrated on the cell surface and within the phagosomes of phagocytically stimulated cells when D-amino acids were provided as substrate. Resting cells showed only slight activity. The competitive inhibitor D,L-2-hydroxybutyrate greatly reduced the D-amino acid-stimulated reaction while KCN did not. The cell surface reaction was abolished by nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzyme activity while that within the phagosome was not eliminated. Dense accumulations of reaction product were formed in cells which phagocytosed Staphylococcus aureus in the absence of exogenous substrate. No reaction product formed with Proteus vulgaris while an intermediate amount formed when Escherichia coli were phagocytosed. Variation in the amount of reaction product with the different bacteria correlated with the levels of D-amino acids in the bacterial cell walls which are available for the DAO of PMNs. An alternative approach utilizing ferricyanide as an electron acceptor was also used. This technique verified the results obtained with the cerium reaction, i.e., the DAO is located in the cell surface and is internalized during phagocytosis and is capable of H2O2 production within the phagosome. The present finding that DAO is localized on the cell surface further supports the concept that the plasma membrane is involved in peroxide formation in PMNs.", "pmid": "26690", "mesh_set": "D002462 D002729 D003486 D003605 D005292 D006801 D006861 D006885 D009504 D010587", "score": 12.768115, "rank": 5535, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Morphine and saline served as discriminative stimuli for one group of rats in a 2-lever discrimination task. LSD and saline were discriminative stimuli for a second group. Depression of one lever in an operant chamber resulted in reinforcement following the administration of morphine or LSD and the opposite lever was reinforced after saline. After discriminated responding was stable, stimulus generalization tests with narcotic analgesics and antagonists showed that the stimulus properties of morphine generalized to methadone and meperidine, and partially to pentazocine, all of which produce morphine-like subjective effects in humans. Morphine stimulus properties did not generalize to nalorphine or cyclazocine, which produce dissimilar subjective effects. The stimulus properties of LSD generalized partially to cyclazocine, but not to nalorphine.

This study reports the effect of alpha and beta adrenergic blockade on this shunting. Sixty-three anesthetized mongrel dogs were ventilated with a mechanical respirator. Measurements of (1) the pulmonary shunt, (2) cardiac output, (3) mean pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary wedge and systemic pressures, and (4) pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were obtained at 5, 15 and 30 minute intervals during the first hour and hourly for 5 hours. Fifteen dogs received no treatment. All others received epinephrine hydrochloride, 2 mug/kg/min for 5 hours. Ten received epinephrine only. Ten were pretreated with propranolol hydrochloride, 250 mug/kg, 12 with phenoxybenzamine, 1 mg/kg, and 16 with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Propranolol significantly decreased the epinephrine induced pulmonary shunt at all times and was the most effective drug. Phenoxybenzamine decreased the early shunting, but less than propranolol, and did not decrease the late shunting. Blockade with propranolol and phenoxybenzamine was less effective than propranolol alone. Based on the observed hemodynamic changes it was suggested that beta blockade is effective in reducing epinephrine induced pulmonary insufficiency by favorably altering the flow and distribution of pulmonary blood flow which in turn decreases epinephrine induced ventilation-perfusion inequalities and capillary hypertension both of which result in shunting. Conversely phenoxybenzamine has an unfavorable effect on the pulmonary flow. These studies support previous work in animals and man which showed that beta adrenergic stimulation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary insufficiency. Because the amounts of epinephrine used produce blood levels observed in critical illness, these studies add support to a relationship between the increased catecholamine stimulation of critical illness and the associated and often unexplained pulmonary insufficiency.", "pmid": "5061", "mesh_set": "D000317 D000319 D000818 D001794 D002196 D002245 D002302 D004285 D004837 D010100 D010643 D011433 D011652 D011941 D012131 D014655 D014692", "score": 14.66918, "rank": 4779, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

ANCA induced after-contractions which followed the twitches evoked by either direct or indirect stimulation. In the intermittently stimulated muscle the height of the after-contractions decreased rather rapidly and in an oscillatory fashion. The maximum height of each after-contraction was attained after the twitch had reached its peak. AChE inhibition changed the shape of these after-contractions in the indirectly, but not in the directly stimulated diaphragm. After AChE inhibition, the after-contractions decreased more slowly and in a non-oscillatory manner. Similar phenomena were observed in vivo in the gastrocnemius--soleus muscles. The effects of ANCA in the AChE-inhibited and in the non-inhibited diaphragm could be mimicked by incubation in low chloride media. Addition of ouabain to the non-inhibited diaphragm treated with ANCA, caused an immediate and striking enhancement followed by a rapid loss of the after-contractions, whereas the twitches remained fairly constant. In the AChE-inhibited diaphragm treated with ANCA, ouabain caused no increase but only a rapid and complete decay of the after-contractions with a decrease of the twitches. It is suggested that after inhibition of the AChE in the ANCA-treated muscle fibre, the site of initiation of the repetitive action potentials which cause the after-contractions shifts from the transverse tubular system to the motor end-plate.

Whole tissue studies were then performed in lungs of laboratory animals. One-ml samples containing purified PMN elastase were instilled into lavaged and saline-perfused isolated dog lung at the level of the sixth to seventh generation bronchus. Treatment with 384 mug of the PMN enzyme produced anatomic emphysema after a 90-min incubation at room temperature, which was comparable to that produced by 100 mug of porcine pancreatic elastase. Frozen sections of treated and control lungs were examined for the presence of PMN elastase by the indirect immunoperoxidase method using a monospecific rabbit antiserum against PMN elastase as the primary stain.

Triton X-100 is the detergent that gives optimal activity, but the Triton X-100-activated enzyme is stimulated an additional 2-fold by E. coli phospholipids. Phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol are the most effective lipid activators. The activated complex prepared with diphosphatidylglycerol is stable, whereas that with phosphatidylglycerol loses activity rapidly. Maximum activation by phospholipids occurs after preincubation at 0 degrees C and at pH 7. Triton X-100 is required at low concentrations for lipid activation, but high concentrations interfere with the activation. When the enzyme is optimally activated by phospholipids, it may be additionally activated 2-fold by spermidine, but not by magnesium. In contrast, the Triton X-100-activated form of the enzyme is stimulated by several divalent cations, without specificity. Thus, the most stable, active form of the purified NADH dehydrogenase is generated in the presence of diphosphatidylglycerol and spermidine.", "pmid": "16660", "mesh_set": "D002413 D004926 D006863 D009247 D010743 D011092 D000644 D013696", "score": 16.223846, "rank": 3983, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Therefore, the rate of washout for this slow component of red cells, from cat spleens, was measured as a function of pH and flow rate of the perfusate. The volume of solution (V 1/2) for 50% washout of 'bound' cells decreased as pH was lowered from 7.8 to 6.6, especially (from 97 to 18 ml/g) between 7.4 and 6.6.

Marine mollusks are apt to accumulate high levels of arsenic, but knowledge related to arsenic detoxification in marine mollusks is still less than sufficient. In this study, arsenic bioaccumulation as well as the role of glutathione S-transferase omega (GST\u03a9) in the process of detoxification were investigated in the Ruditapes philippinarum clam after waterborne exposure to As(III) or As(V) for 30 days. The results showed that the gills accumulated significantly higher arsenic levels than the digestive glands. Arsenobetaine (AsB) and dimethylarsenate (DMA) accounted for most of the arsenic found, and monomethylarsonate (MMA) can be quickly metabolized. A subcellular distribution analysis showed that most arsenic was in biologically detoxified metal fractions (including metal-rich granules and metallothionein-like proteins), indicating their important roles in protecting cells from arsenic toxicity. The relative mRNA expressions of two genes encoding GST\u03a9 were up-regulated after arsenic exposure, and the transcriptional responses were more sensitive to As(III) than As(V). The recombinant GST\u03a9s exhibited high activities at optimal conditions, especially at 37\u2009\u00b0C and pH 4-5, with an As(V) concentration of 60\u2009mM.

In four normal men NSGP increased 2.3-fold by 5 min and remained elevated for 15 min. There was no change in arterial insulin concentration. To study the effect of exogenous insulin on this glucagon-induced increase in NSGP, insulin was infused at 10 mU/kg/min in four normal men to achieve arterial immunoreactive insulin concentrations of 1500 muU/ml (1 X 10(-8) M). Blood glucose was stabilized by glucose infusions. During insulin and glucose administration, NSGP was suppressed and net splanchnic glucose uptake occurred.
