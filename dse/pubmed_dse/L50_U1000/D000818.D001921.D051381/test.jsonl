Electroencephalography (EEG) was used for sleep measures, and analogue scales were used for subjective assessments of well-being and sleep quality. 2 Effects on total sleep time were limited to the night of ingestion. There were increases with nordiazepam (5 and 10 mg) (P = 0.05) and 0.001 respectively), and with clorazepate (15 mg) (P = 0.01). Sleep onset latencies were shortened, particularly with nordiazepam, and awakening to stage 0 activity was reduced, by both drugs. The latency to stage 3 was reduced by nordiazepam (5 and 10 mg) (P = 0.05). 3 There were no effects of nordiazepam (5 mg) on the duration (min) of sleep stages. Nordiazepam (10 mg) and clorazepate (15 mg) reduced the duration of stage 0 and stage 1, and there were increases in stage 2. Reduced stage 1 and increased stage 2 sleep were observed during the recovery night. No effects were observed with stage 3, but there was evidence that stage 4 activity was depressed on the recovery night only. No effects were observed on REM sleep, except that the appearnace of the first REM period was delayed with clorazepate (15 mg) P = 0.01). The effect of nordiazepam (10 mg) and clorazepate (15 mg) were comparable, and each modified sleep for about 28-30 h after ingestion. 4 With nordiazepam (10 mg) and clorazepate (15 mg) the subjects, as a group, reported improved sleep, but subjective assessments of well-being were not altered. Correlations were calculated for sleep measures and subjective assessments.", "pmid": "9963", "mesh_set": "D000328 D014151 D002986 D003009 D003975 D006801 D008297 D003708 D012890 D012894 D013997", "score": 20.104248, "rank": 2215, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Fetal and maternal blood glucose, insulin and acid base observations following maternal glucose infusion.", "abstract": "The aim of the present investigation was to examine the fetal and maternal blood glucose and insulin response following glucose infusion to the mother. The studies were performed on 11 primigravid patients with a gestational age of 38-40 weeks during the first stage of labor. Glucose was given intravenously by a bolus injection of 330 mg/kg body weight, followed by a glucose infusion of 27.5 mg/kg/min for 60 min. Glucose concentration, immuno-reactive insulin (IRI), pH and base excess of the maternal and fetal blood were measured before and during maternal glucose load. Maternal blood glucose rose within 10 min. up to 280.0 mg% (SD 25.9). This level could be fairly maintained throughout the experiment. The maternal glucose was after 60 min. infusion 326.5 mg% (SD 46.9). Fetal glucose concentration rose continuously from 65.8 mg% (SD 5.8) at control to 249.2 mg% (SD 23.3) after 60 min. The increase of maternal and fetal glucose was associated with an elevation of immuno-reactive insulin (IRI). The maternal insulin was 24.0 micronU/ml (SD 8.0). It was scattered over a wide range (55.4 micronU/ml-217.1 micronU/ml) after 60 min. glucose infusion. The fetal insulin was 17.0 micronU/ml (SD 5.2) at control and rose by 86.5% (SD 80.5) after 60 min. glucose load. One case of a mother with a subclinical diabetes mellitus deviated where the fetal insulin rose from 26.0 micronU/ml at control to 215.6 micronU/ml after 60 min. infusion. The increase of insulin per glucose rise was correlated to fetal body weight. During glucose infusion to the mother of both, fetal and maternal, acid base parameters remained unchanged. From these observations it may be concluded that in the human fetus insulin secretion following a single glucose load is generally low, however, it increases in cases where the maternal insulin response to glucose load is abnormal. This might be related to a chronic stimulation by glucose of the fetal pancreatic islet cells in poorly controlled diabetic and possibly prediabetic patients.", "pmid": "19572", "mesh_set": "D000136 D001724 D001786 D005260 D005312 D005947 D006801 D006863 D007231 D007263 D007275 D007328 D007743 D011247", "score": 13.623948, "rank": 5215, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

An organism utilizing benzonitrile as sole carbon and nitrogen source was isolated by the enrichment-culture technique and identified as a Nocardia sp. of the rhodochrous group. 2. Respiration studies indicate that nitrile degradation proceeds through benzoic acid and catechol. 3. Cell-free extracts of benzonitrile-grown cells contain an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of benzonitrile directly into benzoic acid without intermediate formation of benzamide. 4. This nitrilase enzyme was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 in the presence and absence of substrate. The purity of the enzyme was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gel. 5. The enzyme shows a time-dependent substrate-activation process in which the substrate catalyses the association of inactive subunits of mol.wt. 45000 to form the polymeric 12-unit active enzyme of mol.wt. 560000. The time required for complete association is highly dependent on the concentration of the enzyme, temperature and pH. 6. The associated enzyme has a pH optimum of 8.0 and K(m) with benzonitrile as substrate of 4mm. The activation energy of the reaction as deduced from the Arrhenius plot is 51.8kJ/mol. 7. Enzyme activity is inhibited by thiol-specific reagents and several metal ions. 8. Studies with different substrates indicate that the nitrilase is specific for nitrile groups directly attached to the benzene ring. Various substituents in the ring are compatible with activity, though ortho-substitution, except by fluorine, renders the nitrile invulnerable to attack. 9. The environmental implications of these findings and the possible significance of the enzyme in the regulation of metabolism are discussed.", "pmid": "21655", "mesh_set": "D000619 D001549 D001555 D006863 D008970 D009570 D009615 D013696", "score": 16.901836, "rank": 3629, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Induction and 'superinduction' of sialylation of membrane-bound gamma-glutamyltransferase during liver regeneration.", "abstract": "The present paper shows that in the regenerating rat liver the membrane-bound-gamma-glutamyltransferase exists in two molecular forms. Depending on the state of proliferation, a sialic-acid-rich enzyme (in the fetal or regenerating liver) or a sialic-acid-poor enzyme (in the adult or quiescent liver) could be detected. In regeneration liver (24 h after 2/3 resection) only the sialic-acid-rich or fetal enzyme could be found. Since total enzyme activity (adult + fetal type) remained unchanged, it is assumed that the adult type of gamma-glutamyltransferase was modified by sialylation during the initial phase of liver regeneration. This process of sialylation was prevented by inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis such as D-galactosamine, actinomycin D or cycloheximide, provided that the inhibitor (D-galactosamine) was given within the first 8 h after partial hepatectomy. Sialylation was not impaired by inhibitors of DNA synthesis, e.g. hydroxyurea or cytosine arabinoside. Administration of actinomycin D during a defined phase of proliferation (24 to 48 h after partial hepatectomy) stimulated the transfer of sialic acid to gamma-glutamyltransferase, a finding which describes for the first time the so-called 'superinduction' of a sialylation process.", "pmid": "23292", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004790 D005333 D005688 D007700 D008099 D008115 D008297 D051381 D012794 D005723", "score": 14.936291, "rank": 4640, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

These problems were alleviated by addition of half concentration (7-5%) of pooled normal human serum to all cultures, the intoruction of anti-lymphocyte serum as a suitable internal control for monitoring the suppressability of lymphocytes and a reduction of specific activity of the [3H]thymidine to 1-3 C2/mM.

The purified preparation was found to be homogeneous on disc gel electrophoresis. The SH groups of the enzyme were modified with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to determine the number of SH groups per molecule and their contribution to the enzyme activity. One SH group was titrated with DTNB per subunit (the native enzyme consisted of two subunits) and after complete denaturation with 4 M guanidine-HCl the number of titratable SH groups remained unchanged. ORD and CD measurements showed that the alpha-helical conformation of the polypeptide backbone was unaffected by DTNB modification, though the near ultraviolet CD spectrum was evidently altered. The fluorescence derived from tryptophanyl residue(s) was quenched by the modification to 30% of the native level, which may indicate the presence of SH in the vicinity of tryptophanyl residue(s). A remarkable decrease of the enzyme activity was detected upon modification with DTNB, but there was some discrepancy between the rate of inactivation and that of modification of SH groups. The presence of substrate and Mg2+ gave partial protection against modification of the SH groups by DTNB.

Of eight reducing agents examined, including glutathione, ascorbic acid, and intermediates of the glycolytic and hexose monophosphate shunt pathways, only the pyridine nucleotides could serve as electron donors. At 0.1 mM pyridine nucleotide, O2- production was relatively independent of pH. The Km for NADH was approximately 0.7 mM regardless of pH, while with NADPH the Km varied from 0.02 mM at pH 6.0 to 0.3 mM at pH 7.5. The molar ratio of NADPH oxidized to O2- produced was consistent with the reaction: NADPH + 2 O2- leads to NADP+ H+; the product nucleotide was shown enzymatically to be NADP. O2- production was not inhibited by CN-, Na-, EDTA, or 1,10-phenanthroline. Particulate O2- production accounted for 35% of the oxygen taken up during the respiratory burst by an equivalent number of intact neutrophils. Greatly diminished O2- production was seen with particles prepared from cells obtained from three patients with chronic granulomatous disease, with 2.5 mM NADPH as electron donor. With 5.0 mM NADH similar observations were made with particles from two of the patients, but with this nucelotide, O2- production was only slightly reduced in the third case.

{"title": "Calcium uptake by subcellular fractions of human umbilical artery.", "abstract": "Two different mechanisms for the active accumulation of Ca2+ by subcellular fractions of human umbilical artery are described. One, located in the mitochondrial fraction, was induced by exogenous ATP or respiratory substrates (ADP and succinate) and was inhibited by azide. The other, located in the microsomal fraction, was induced by ATP and potentiated by oxalate, but not inhibited by azide. Increasing ATP concentrations up to 4-5 mM increased microsomal Ca2+ accumulation, whereas increasing ATP concentration above 2-3 mM caused inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Although changing pH from 7.4 to 7.2 had no effect on mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, it doubled microsomal uptake. Neither adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate nor guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the presence or absence of protein kinase and kinase modulator affected Ca2+ uptake by or phosphorylation of the subcellular fractions. Partially purified protein kinases from umbilical and beef skeletal muscle contained a component(s) distinguishable from the kinase on the basis of its heat stability that enhanced ATP-induced Ca2+ uptake by mitochondrial fractions from the umbilical artery.

Kinetic relationships referring to multiple-turnover conditions have been derived for the slowest exponential transient appearing in two-substrate enzyme reactions proceeding by an ordered ternary-complex mechanism. The validity of these and previously derived theoretical relationships for this mechanism has been tested by application to the liver alcohol dehydrogenase reaction. 2. All essential features of the transient-state kinetics of alcohol oxidation by NAD+ in the liver alcohol dehydrogenase system can be qualitatively and quantitatively explained in view of the compulsory-order mechanism in the proposed scheme. There is no kinetic evidence for any half-of-the-sites reactivity of the enzyme. A consistent set of rate constants is reported for the enzymic oxidation of benzyl alcohol at pH 8.75. 3. Transient-state rate parameters for benzyl alcohol/benzaldehyde catalysis by liver alcohol dehydrogenase have been determined at different pH. The interpretation of such rate parameters is critically discussed with reference to their informative value for the purpose of determination of rate constants (k and k') for the process of ternary-complex interconversion in the proposed scheme. It is concluded that the apparent rate constant (k') for hydride transfer from benzyl alcohol to NAD+ is dependent on a proton dissociation step with a pKa of 6.4, whereas the rate constant (k) for hydride transfer from NADH to benzaldehyde exhibits no corresponding dependence on proton association. 4. The asymmetric pH dependence of the forward and reverse rate of ternary-complex interconversion during liver alcohol dehydrogenase catalysis appears to reflect an obligatory step of alcohol/alcoholate ion equilibration occurring at the ternary-complex level. It is suggested that the observed pKa 6.4 dependence of the transient rate of alcohol oxidation can be attributed to a coupled acid-base system involving minimally the enzyme-bound alcohol and the protein residues Ser-48 and His-51.", "pmid": "27359", "mesh_set": "D000429 D000818 D001592 D006736 D006863 D007700 D008099 D046911 D008433 D009243 D011485", "score": 11.4333, "rank": 5879, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Inhibition of responsiveness was observed with concentrations of GST equivalent to gold levels found in serum or tissues of patients receiving chrysotherapy, Inhibition was dependent upon the gold ion itself since GST and gold chloride were both inhibitory whereas thiomalic acid was not. Inhibition could not be explained by nonspecific killing of cells or by an alteration in the kinetics of the responses. GST inhibited mitogen-induced proliferation most effectively when present from the initiation of culture and could not inhibit the responsiveness of cells which previously had been activated by concanvalin A. These findings indicated that GST blocked a critical early step in lymphocyte activation. The degree of GST-induced inhibition of proliferation was increased in cultures of cells partially depleted of monocytes. Moreover, inhibition was reversed by supplementation of these cultures with purified monocytes. These observations suggested that GST blocked thymus-derived (T)-lymphocyte activation by interfering with a requisite function of the monocyte population in initiating such responses. Prolonged incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with GST resulted in diminished mitogen responsiveness upon subsequent culture in the absence of gold. The addition of fresh monocytes restored responsiveness to these populations. Furthermore, preincubation of purified monocytes with GST rendered them deficient in their ability to support mitogen-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation on subsequent culture. These observations indicate that the major effect of GST results from interference with the functional capability of the monocyte population.", "pmid": "838859", "mesh_set": "D000941 D003208 D004247 D006046 D006801 D066298 D037102 D008213 D008214 D009000 D013870 D013997", "score": 13.521308, "rank": 5253, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

We varied (1) car approach scenario (passing, colliding, stopping), (2) traffic complexity (one or two approaching cars), and (3) cyclist's approach speed (15, 25, or 35\u2009km/h). Results showed that participants looked at the approaching car when it was relevant to the task of crossing the intersection and posed an imminent hazard, and they directed less attention to the car after it had stopped or passed the intersection. Traffic complexity resulted in divided attention between the two cars, but participants retained most visual attention to the car that came from the right and had right of way.

This change in policy from previous reliance on removal by sewage treatment has been adopted for the following reasons: (1) Bans on phosphates will reduce capital and operating costs of treatment and, were adopted, have met with consumer acceptance. (2) In practice, treatment plants have not met design expectations for phosphate removal. (3) Neither nitrilotriacetic acid nor other substitutes for phosphates have proved to be a public health problem. (4) Reduction of phosphorus loadings to treatment plants avoids increasing levels of chlorides and total dissolved solids in effluents.

{"title": "Selective association of spectrin with the cytoplasmic surface of human erythrocyte plasma membranes.

Spectrin was labeled by incubating erythrocytes with 32Pi, and eluted from the ghost membranes by extraction in 0.3 mM NaPO4, pH 7.6. [32P]Spectrin was separated from actin and other proteins and isolated in a nonaggregated state as a So20,w = 7 S (in 0.3 mM NaPO4) or So20,w = 8 S (in 20 mM KCl, 0.3 mM NaPO4) protein after sedimentation on linear sucrose gradients. Binding of [32P]spectrin to inverted vesicles devoid of spectrin and actin was at least 10-fold greater than to right side out membranes, and exhibited different properties. Association with inside out vesicles was slow, was decreased to the value for right side out vesicles at high pH, or after heating spectrin above 50 degrees prior to assay, and was saturable with increasing levels of spectrin. Binding to everted vesicles was rapid, unaffected by pH or by heating spectrin, and rose linearly with the concentration of spectrin. Scatchard plots of binding to inverted vesicles were linear at pH 7.6, with a KD of 45 microng/ml, while at pH 6.6, plots were curvilinear and consistent with two types of interactions with a KD of 4 and 19 microng/ml, respectively. The maximal binding capacity at both pH values was about 200 microng of spectrin/mg of membrane protein. Unlabeled spectrin competed for binding with 50% displacement at 27 microng/ml. [32P]Spectrin dissociated and associated with inverted vesicles with an identical dependence on ionic strength as observed for elution of native spectrin from ghosts. MgCl2, CaCl2 (1 to 4 mM) and EDTA (0.5 to 1 mM) had little effect on binding in the presence of 20 mM KCl, while at low ionic strength, MgCl2 (1 mM) increased binding and inhibited dissociation to the same extent as 10 to 20 mM KCl. Binding was abolished by pretreatment of vesicles with 0.1 M acetic acid, or with 0.1 microng/ml of trypsin. The periodic acid-Schiff-staining bands were unaffected by trypsin digestion which destroyed binding; mild digestion, which decreased binding only 50%, converted Band 3 almost completely to a membrane-bound 50,000-dalton fragment resistant to further proteolysis. These experiments suggest that attachment of spectrin to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane results from a selective protein-protein interaction which is independent of erythrocyte actin.

{"title": "[Parenteral use of a solution-emulsion following digestive surgery].", "abstract": "A post-operative use of the calorico-nitrogenous mixture: Triv\u00e9 1000 was carried out in 25 patients after digestive surgery. The prescribed dose of this lipidic emulsion was 1,36 1 for an average period of four days. A study of the results led to establish the following facts:--a 55 p. cent increase in the nitrogen retention in comparison with a control series of ten patients and from (J o) the day of the intervention to (J F) the day when the treatment was stopped. Besides, the duration of the treatment did not seem to modify this balance, at least within the limits of the period of use. On the other hand, the quantity of EB 51 was a determining factor since 2000 ml were necessary to obtain a positive nitrogen balance (+ 0.96 g).--a very small rise in the amino-acid serous rate. It appeared in 14 patients and, supplied by EB 51, 3 other amino-acids increased their proportion spontaneously (Asp.--Gluc.--Tau.).--a reduction of the rate of 5 amino-acids, one of which, however, (Arginine) was being supplied by the drip. The variations were never statistically significant but for the Phenylalanine rate increase.--a non-systematic variation in the blood proteids that decreased as far as total proteids and albumin were concerned and that increased as far as globulins alpha1 and alpha2 were concerned.--Finally, no variations in the serous graphic record of lipid levels were noted, neither in the average of figures, nor in the analyses carried out after each bottle. Besides, it must be added that the tolerance of the product was excellent both on a general level (very few cases of intolerance: 4) and on the level of the plasma turbidimetry which did not reveal and chylomicrons except in one case. Therefore Triv\u00e9 1000 proved to be an interesting nutrient combinatin quite suited to a parenteral feeding because of its high caloric power. The necessity of a calories/g/nitrogen ratio from 100 to 200 corresponding to 2000 ml of EB 51 was once more evidenced. Therefore such a dose (for lack of a protein assimilation) allows for a nitrogen retention important enough to prevent an excessive consumption of the body proteinic reserves.

The rates of hydrolysis of 26 synthetic dipeptides by extracts from highly purified lysosomal fractions from rat liver at pH 5.0 and by whole liver homogenates at pH 7.4 have been determined. Extracts from the lysosomal fractions hydrolysed most peptides at a lower rate per mg protein than the homogenates, and some peptides not at all. 2. Properties of two dipeptidases present in the extracts from the lysosomal fractions, splitting Ile-Glu and Leu-Gly, respectively, were studied in greater detail. The enzyme that hydrolysed Ile-Glu was strongly activated by dithiothreitol, showed optimal activity at pH 4.5 and had a molecular weight of about 120 000. Leu-Gly dipeptidase did apparently not contain an essential thiol group and had a molecular weight of approx. 90 000. It showed maximal activity at pH 6.5. 3. After differential centrifugation of liver homogenates, Ile-Glu and Leu-Gly-splitting activities were determined in the fractions, under the optimal conditions mentioned above. The Ile-Glu-hydrolysing enzyme activity showed about the same distribution as the lysosomal marker enzyme acid phosphatase. Leu-Gly-splitting activity, however, was largely present in the cytosol fraction, with only a small peak in the lysosomal fraction. We obtained evidence that the activities present in the lysosomal fraction and in the cytosol fraction were due to different enzymes, and that one of these enzymes was localized exclusively in lysosomes. 4.

The buffers at pH's 3 and 5 probably caused different amounts of warfarin precipitation, which resulted in different rates of warfarin disappearance from the instilled fluid which paralleled the initial rates of accumulation of warfarin in (or on) the intestinal wall. Where greater drug precipitation had probably occurred the initial rates of absorption into the plasma were slower. At the initial pH of 3 and by solubilization of warfarin with propylene glycol, the rate of absorption was similar to that from a fluid of pH 7. Propylene glycol in 15% solution did not affect the system significantly. The relatively high transfer of warfarin into octanol from buffer solution at pH 7 might indicate that the small fraction of unionized drug (1 : 100) at pH 7 is enough for remarkable transfer of this highly lipid-soluble drug.", "pmid": "7646", "mesh_set": "D000818 D006863 D007408 D008297 D000442 D011409 D051381 D012995 D013997 D014859 D014867", "score": 19.913254, "rank": 2273, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Glutamate dehydrogenase from mantle muscle is located intra-mitochondrially, has a molecular weight of 310,000, and is electrophoretically similar to the enzyme from all other squid tissues. 3. The enzyme from mantle muscle  was purified 40-fold by elution from DEAE-cellulose and used for kinetic studies. The enzyme is NAD+-specific, activated by ADP, AMP, and leucine, and inhibited by GTP, GDP, ATP, and reaction products (in particular NADH). 4. Squid glutamate dehydrogenase shows an almost absolute dependence on ADP. The purified enzyme is activated over 100-fold by saturating concentrations of ADP (Ka = 0,75 7M); The pH optima are also altered significantly by ADP. 5. The enzyme appears to be kinetically adapted to favour glutamate oxidation in comparison to glutamate dehydrogenase from other resources.

Activator protein was incubated with sulphatides under conditions used favouring the sulphatase activity. Incubation solutions were then examined by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel gradient. An one-to-one complex between activator and sulphatides was observed. Half maximal binding occurred with 2.5 nmol of sulphatides together with 1 or 2 nmol of activator in 100 micronl. 3. Cerebrosides as the enzymic degradation products of sulphatides, bind also to the activator protein. A ratio of one-to-one could possibly be obtained at high cerebroside concentrations. The binding to cerebrosides is less specific than that to sulphatides. A 7-fold excess of cerebrosides was necessary for half maximal binding. 4.

The antitumor effect of poly(l)-ploy(C) was found to be dose dependent. Multiple injections of 100 microng poly(l)-poly(C) per mouse (congruent to 5 mg/kg) almost completely arrested tumor growth, but even at 1microng/mouse (congruent to 50 microng/kg), poly(l)-poly(C) caused a partial reduction in tumor growth. Mouse interferon administered exogenously in amounts that closely mimicked the interferon blood levels induced endogenously by poly(l)-poly(C) failed to duplicate the antitumor effects of poly(l)-poly(C). Hence, the role of interferon induction in the mechanism of antitumor action of poly(l)-poly(C) can be eliminated.

{"title": "Sleep and respiration of rats during hypoxia.", "abstract": "1. The effects of hypoxia on slow-wave sleep (SWS) and of SWS on respiratory responses to hypoxia were investigated on rats provided with chronically implanted cortical electrodes. 2. During the daytime (5-7 hr periods) the proportion of time spent in SWS was 45% (S.E. +/- 1.0%) when the rats breathed air. Exposure to 10% O2 (equivalent to 18,000 ft.) reduced this proportion to 27% (S.E. +/- 2.5%). During hypoxia the intensity of e.e.g. activity in SWS (mean, rectified slow-wave voltage) rarely equalled the normal values characteristic of the same rats in fully developed SWS breathing air. The normal pattern of 5-15 min episodes of SWS was changed by hypoxia to a series of brief (2-3 min) incompletely developed episodes. 3. Addition of CO2 to inspired gas failed to prevent the reduction of SWS during hypoxia. CO2 in normal O2 did not alter sleep significantly. The effects of hypoxia on sleep therefore depend upon changes in O2 pressure rather than upon changes in CO2. 4. The effect of SWS on respiration of rats breathing air was to decrease frequency and minute volume by 10-20%. In hypoxia, however, the frequency increased markedly when the animals entered SWS ; minute volume was not significantly changed. It follows that stimulation of breathing by hypoxia is greater during SWS than during wakefulness. 5. The anomalous increase of respiratory frequency when hypoxic rats entered SWS was abolished by addition of CO2 to the hypoxic gas mixture. 6. Steady-state gaseous metabolism (Vo2 Vco2) was decreased 18 +/- 3% during hypoxia and was increased 31 +/- 4% during exposure to 5% CO2.

A kinetic investigation of cortisol, cortisone, cortexolone, and the 21-aldehydes of each indicated: (a) the magnitude of the Michaelis constant for any substrate was independent of the second substrate concentration; (b) the 21-aldehydes had larger Michaelis constants (5- to 8-fold) and larger maximum velocities (16- to 40-fold) than the steroids from which they were synthesized; (c) the Michaelis constant for NADH, 29 muM, was independent of the steroid substrate. With cortisol and cortisol-21-aldehyde, product inhibition patterns showed only slope effects with steroid product and NAD+, suggesting a \"random\" mechanism. Inhibition studies with the \"poor\" substrate cortisol indicated that cortisol and cortisol-21-aldehyde were reduced at the same site. The inhibition constant (180 muM) agreed with the Michaelis constant of cortisol (140 muM). The steroid product, 20beta-hydroxyprogesterone, gives noncompetitive inhibition patterns with respect to NADH and cortisol-21-aldehyde, indicating a separate binding site exists on the enzyme for this inhibitor. The intrinsic protein fluorescence of 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was quenched by NADH (56%) with a dissociation constant of 16 muM. NAD\" quenched the protein fluorescence somewhat less (31%) with a dissociation constant of 104 muM. The fluorescence of 2-p-toluidine-6-naphthalene sulfonate is enhanced in the presence of enzyme, and there is a blue shift in the emission wavelength maximum. The enzyme-enhanced 2-p-toluidine-6-naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence is quenched by NAD+ (32%) with a dissociation constant of 128 muM. Corticosteroids and their corresponding 21-aldehydes completely quench the enhanced 2-p-toluidine-6-naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence and this feature can be used to determine enzyme-steroid dissociation constants. Corticosteroid-21-aldehydes and NAD+ dissociation constants determined in this manner agree with values obtained in kinetic measurements. The dissociation constants determined for cortisol, cortisone, cortexolone, progesterone, and 20beta-hydroxyprogesterone were at least 1 order of magnitude greater than the corresponding kinetic constants, and these findings suggest the presence of a kinetically insignificant binding site.", "pmid": "833119", "mesh_set": "D000305 D000345 D000447 D001665 D003349 D006913 D007700 D008433 D011485 D013329", "score": 12.788017, "rank": 5528, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Cyclohexyl isocyanate was shown to be an active-site-specific inactivator of chymotrypsin. A cyclohexyl isocyanate to enzyme molar ratio of 0.63 was required to produce 50% enzyme inactivation, thus demonstrating the high specificity of inactivation. At 2.38 X 10(-4) M chymotrypsin this near stoichiometric inactivation was not significantly affected by the presence of 1, 5, and 10 mM L-lysine. Degradation of an excess of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-([1-14C]-cyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea in the presence of enzyme yielded 1.11 +/- 0.07 mol of covalently bound [14C]cyclohexyl moiety per mol of enzyme inactivated. Short-term incubation demonstrated that the nitrosourea neither inhibited nor protected the enzyme from cyclohexyl isocyanate inactivation. Treatment of chymotrypsin with less than stoichiometric amounts of cyclohexyl isocyanate or titration of the active-site serine with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride followed by in situ degradation of excess 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-([1-14C]cyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea resulted in a decreased amount of covalently bound 14C proportional to the extent of inactivation by these reagents prior to 14C labeling. These results strongly suggest that cyclohexyl isocyanate, whether added directly or generated by CCNU degradation, reacted almost exclusively with the active site of the enzyme. The extent of this inactivation indicates that 70% of the CCNU degraded in such a manner as to form cyclohexyl isocyanate.", "pmid": "856251", "mesh_set": "D001665 D002918 D003485 D007700 D008130 D009607 D011485", "score": 21.175034, "rank": 1853, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured in nervous tissue from different animals in an attempt to provide more information about the citric acid cycle in this tissue. In higher animals the activities of citrate synthase are greater than the sum of activities of the isocitrate dehydrogenases, whereas they are similar in nervous tissues from the lower animals. This suggests that in higher animals the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is far-removed from equilibrium. If it is assumed that isocitrate dehydrogenase activities provide an indication of the maximum flux through the citric acid cycle, the maximum glycolytic capacity in nervous tissue is considerably greater than that of the cycle. This suggest that glycolysis can provide energy in excess of the aerobic capacity of the tissue. 2. The activities of glutamate dehydrogenase are high in most nervous tissues and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase are high in all nervous tissue investigated. However, the activities of alanine aminotransferase are low in all tissues except the ganglia of the waterbug and cockroach.

Pancuronium is a reversible inhibitor of both AChE and ChE. The inhibitory potency regarding ChE ([I]50=2.7 X 10(-7) M; Ki=4.2 X 10(-8) M) is highly selective and about 1000-fold higher than compared to AChE ([I]50=2.4 X 10(-4) M; Ki=3.5 X 10(-5) M). 3. The kinetic analysis by means of an Lineweaver-Burk plot and an Arunlakshana-Schild plot displayed a pure competitive mechanism of inhibition. 4. The inhibition of AChE and ChE is thought to be induced by a reversible binding of pancuronium to the anionic subsite of the active center, thus decreasing the formation of the primary enzyme-substrate complex. 5. The clinical administration of pancuronium for muscular relaxation during anaesthesia (0.01-0.08 mg/kg) will result in a concentration of approximately 10(-7)=10(-6) M in the extracellular fluid.

{"title": "Two components of the calcium current in the egg cell membrane of the tunicate.", "abstract": "The Ca current of the egg cell membrane of a certain tunicate, Halocynthia roretzi Drasche, was studied by the voltage-clamp technique. 2. The Ca current in the standard artificial sea water (ASW) was produced at the critical membrane potential of -10 mV after inactivating the Na current by conditioning depolarization, -30 to -15 mV. The Ca current was abolished by replacing Ca in ASW with Mg2+ or Mn2+. The Ca current was not significantly influenced by replacing Na in ASW with choline or Cs. 3. The relation of Ca current to the external Ca concentration was a monotonously increasing function, but was not linear. The current tended to saturate above 50 mM-Ca. In 100 mM-Ca ASW, the maximum peak inward current of Ca ranged from 1 to 7 X 10(-9) A. 4. The kinetics of Ca current was accurately analysed because of the small contribution of K outward current and was found to be relatively slow in comparison with the Na current. The peak time and the half-decay time of the maximum Ca current at about 25 mV were about 25 and 100 msec respectively in 100 mM-Ca ASW at 15 degrees C. 5. Addition of 20 mM-Co2+ to 100 mM-Ca ASW reduced Ca current to one fourth and 1 mM-La3+ to 100 mM-Ca ASW abolished the current. 6. Sr and Ba could substitute for Ca in Ca channels. The selectivity ratios for the 'Ca channels's were Ca (1-00):Sr(1-17):Ba(0-71) at a potential level of +40 mV. The Ca current in the egg cell membrane appeared to be essentially the same as the Ca current in the common excitable membranes, such as the crustacean muscle fibre. 7. The polyvalent cations including Ca ion and monovalent H+ ion showed the stabilizing effect upon both Na and Ca currents, by shifting V-I relations along the voltage axis. From the prediction of a theory of the diffuse double layer, the shift in the V-I relation induced by those cations should be directly related to their binding powers to the membrane. Thus, the sequence of the binding powers was inferred as H+ greater than La3+ greater than Co2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Sr2+ larger than or equal to Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. 9. In Na-free ASW, such as isotonic Ca ASW, Ca current was composed of two components. The one component was the Ca current described in 1 to 6. The other was also dependent upon the external Ca concentration, but showed the more negative critical membrane potential and the faster kinetics. It was concluded that this component should be the Ca current through Na channels. 10. The selectivity among Ca, Sr and Ba for 'Ca' current through 'Na channels' was significantly different from that of 'Ca' current through 'Ca channels', being Ca greater than Sr larger than or equal to Ba = 0.", "pmid": "3645", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002118 D002413 D002462 D005260 D006863 D007700 D008564 D010063 D011188 D012964 D014561", "score": 15.158267, "rank": 4527, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

It was found that sensitivity to ACTH was not directed towards the ACTH activity but to the intrinsic melanotropin activity of the ACTH molecule. Therefore, the melanotropin-sensitive adenylate cyclase system is hormonally specific to the intrinsic melanotropin activity of peptide hormones and is unique in the melanoma tissue. The significance of the sensitivity to prostaglandin E1 is obscure at present. The melanotropin-sensitive adenylate cyclase requires the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, for its enzymic activity. Ca2+ inhibit the enzyme in the presence of a wide range of concentrations of Mg2+. The enzymic activity is ATP concentration-dependent and the saturation concentration appears to be 1 mM. The enzyme is very labile in the unfractionated tumor homogenates. A washed 11000 X g particulate fraction, representing about 30-60% of the total enzymic activity, was found to be more stable and could be stored at 5 degrees C for 2 h without appreciable loss of the activity.

At 5 weeks of age all offspring were tested with graded doses of morphine in the hot-plate test for analgesia. Morphine produced a dose-related increase in analgesia in all offspring, but the effect of morphine in the offspring of levorphanol-treated females was significantly reduced compared to the offspring of saline-treated females; the analgesic effect of morphine did not differ between the offspring of the dextrorphan- and saline-treated females. The analgesic effect of morphine remained reduced in 9-week old offspring of levorphanol-treated females compared to the corresponding offspring of females that had received saline. Diminished analgesic activity of morphine in the offspring of levorphanol-treated females compared to the offspring of females that had received dextrorphan or saline was still observed even when the offspring were rendered tolerant to morphine by daily drug injections over a period of 5 days.

{"title": "Some effects of glucose concentration and anoxia on glycolysis and metabolite concentrations in the perfused liver of fetal guinea pig.", "abstract": "Effects of glucose concentration and anoxia upon the metabolite concentrations and rates of glycolysis and respiration have been investigated in the perfused liver of the fetal guinea pig. In most cases the metabolite concentrations in the perfused liver were similar to those observed in vivo. Between 50 days and term there was a fall in the respiratory rate and in the concentration of ATP and fructose 1,6-diphosphate and an increase in the concentration of glutamate, glycogen and glucose. Reducing the medium glucose concentration from 10 mM to 1 mM or 0.1 mM depressed lactate production and the concentration of most of the phosphorylated intermediates (except 6-phosphogluconate) in the liver of the 50-day fetus. This indicates a fall in glycolytic rate which is not in accord with the known kinetic properties of hexokinase in the fetal liver. Anoxia increased lactate production by, and the concentrations of, the hexose phosphates ADP and AMP in the 50-day to term fetal liver, while the concentration of ribulose 5-phosphate, ATP and some triose phosphates fell. These results are consistent with an activation of glycolysis, particularly at phosphofructokinase and of a reduction in pentose phosphate pathway activity, particularly at 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The calculated cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio for the perfused liver was similar to that measured in vivo and evidence is presented to suggest that the dihydroxyacetone phosphate/glycerol 3-phosphate ratio gives a better indication of cytosolic redox than the lactate/pyruvate ratio.

Treatment of rats with phenobarbital increased rates of p-nitroanisole O-demethylation approx. fivefold. The concentrations of lactate, xylulose 5-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate were increased by phenobarbital treatment, whereas that of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate declined. Perfusion of livers with p-nitroanisole produced significant increases in 6-phosphogluconate and ribulose 5-phosphate in livers from phenobarbital-treated rats, but not in livers from control rats. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital caused [NADP(+)]/[NADPH] to change in the direction of more oxidation, as calculated from measured concentrations of 6-phosphogluconate and ribulose 5-phosphate; however, the [NADP(+)]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from ;malic' enzyme was not changed.

Perfusion of livers with two other substrates for mixed-function oxidation, hexobarbital and aminopyrine, produced an increase in the [NADP(+)]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from ;malic' enzyme. In contrast with livers perfused with p-nitroanisole, there was no significant change in adenine nucleotides in livers exposed to hexobarbital or aminopyrine. Addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol (25mum) to the perfusate containing aminopyrine decreased the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio and tended to prevent the oxidation of NADPH observed with aminopyrine alone.

Tissue concentrations of B-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate did not exceed extracellular levels. Placenta, fetal brain, carcass, and liver all oxidized 14C-labeled B-hydroxybutyrate to 14CO2 when incubated in vitro in the presence of B-hydroxybutyrate. Highest rates of oxidation were apparent in the placenta, followed by brain, liver, and carcass. The D isomer of B-hydroxybutyrate appeared to be oxidized preferentially by all tissues studied. Despite levels of 3-ketoacid CoA transferase and acetoacetyl CoA thiolase lower at 18 than at 20 days, rates of oxidation in individual tissues incubated under identical concentrations of substrate were similar at both times. In liver and brain, increasing rates of 14CO2 generation proportionate to graded concentrations of B-hydroxybutyrate in vitro indicated that such rates were probably determined by substrate availability.

Kinetic analysis revealed two distinct saturable uptake systems for each amino acid in the 4 CNS areas. The high affinity systems (apparent Km: 9-22 muM for GABA; 5-35 muM for glycine) required sodium ions in the medium and were relatively substrate specific. Significant release of [3H]GABA and [3H]glycine, but not of L-[3H]leucine, was evoked by exposure to medium containing potassium ions in a concentration of 40 mM.

Both compounds were completely absorbed, and all radioactivity found in the serum was due to clofibric acid (CPIB). Tissues contained readily detectable radioactivity levels, but the concentration was generally lower than in serum. A large proportion of CPIB in liver, heart, kidney, fat and muscle was associated with intracellular space. In rat urine, CPIB was present both free and conjugated with glucuronic acid. Approximately 97% of the serum CPIB was not conjugated. Identical decreases in serum lipids and hepatic cholesterol synthesis were observed in rats treated for 1 week with either compound. In dogs, the serum contained 40% more radioactivity after [14C]clofibric acid than after an equimolar oral dose of [14C]clofibrate; approximately 88% of the serum radioactivity was due to CPIB. Some biliary excretion was detected. The extent of binding to serum protein varied with concentration of CPIB and with the species; the affinity was in the order man greater than dog greater than rat. The results demonstrate that clofibric acid and clofibrate are metabolically and pharmacologically equivalent in rats, but not in dogs.

On the other hand, rabbit microsomes exhibited higher lipid peroxidation activity than guinea pigs in ascorbic acid plus Fe++ or Fe++-dependent lipid peroxidation although the activity was still lower than in rats. The ascorbic acid plus Fe++-stimulated lipid peroxidation produced a decrease in ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity which was closely related to ethylmorphine-enhanced NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase activity but was not related to the change of the apparent content of cytochrome P-450 in all animal species.

{"title": "Effects of acceleration on thermoregulatory responses of unanesthetized rats.", "abstract": "Upon exposure of rats to 2 G environments (achieved by centrifugation), there occurred a rapid decrease in colonic temperature (Tco) followed, after about 50 min, by a slow recovery toward precentrifugation levels. The initial drop in Tco was accompanied by decreases in hypothalamic and spinal cord temperatures and increases in tail temperature (Tta). In contrast to this anomalous response (i.e., increased heat loss (manifested by increased Tta) despite decreasing temperature at spinal and hypothalamic thermoreceptor areas) the return toward normal Tco appeared to involve appropriate thermoregulatory responses. The initial fall in Tco was decreased in magnitude by inverting the rat during acceleration, thereby suggesting that mechanical forces acting on the brain may underlie this temperature decrease. Exposure to cold during centrifugation allowed further examination of the thermoregulatory system. Unlike the initial acceleration-induced changes, the cold-evoked fall in Tco was not accompanied by increasing Tta and was modified by the environmental conditioning of the rats. These results are consistent with the view that exposure to 2 G adversely affects the thermoregulatory ability of rats challenged by cold.", "pmid": "833080", "mesh_set": "D000054 D000818 D001833 D003080 D008297 D011187 D011301 D051381 D013116 D013997", "score": 20.430748, "rank": 2096, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In the posthypnotic hour there was a significant increase of secretion in the placebo-series, while there was virtually no change in the the bromazepam-series. The pattern of acid output in the placebo-series seems to result from an activation of the sympathetic system under anxiety and a rebound vagal activation in the posthypnotic hour.

{"title": "Genic similarity of American and European species of the lobster Homarus.", "abstract": "European lobsters (Homarus gammarus) from the Norway coast and from the Irish Sea are examined for electrophoretically detectable genetic variation in seventeen functionally different proteins. Forty-one loci encoding these proteins are homologous with loci studied in a previous survey of eight populations of H. americanus. Progeny hatched from ovigerous Norway females show variation in three enzymes, but Mendelian inheritance is confirmed only for triosephosphate isomerase and for one of the phosphoglucose isomerases. Complex PGI phenotypes are described. The average amounts of genetic variability in European and American lobster populations appear to be equivalent. More than one allele is detected at 20% of the loci, the average number of alleles detected per locus is 1.2 and the average proportion of loci heterozygous per individual is 4.0%. While much less genically variable than other invertebrates, Homarus is not atypical when compared with eleven decapod species that average 5.8% heterozygosity. This is consistent with hypotheses relating genetic variability to adaptive strategy. At thirty loci H. gammarus is monomorphic for the common H. americanus allele. Two acid phosphatase systems are fixed or nearly fixed for alternative alleles in the two species while the remaining polymorphic loci show various degrees of interspecific divergence. Unique H. gammarus alleles are detected at five loci but only contribute significantly to species differences at the Acph-5, Me, and Pgi-4 loci. Acph-1, Est-2, Pgi-3, and Pgm-1 are polymorphic for the same alleles in both species, but again, with various differences in allelic frequencies. In sum, average genetic identity and average genetic distance are: I = 0.896 +/- 0.007 and D = 0.110 +/- 0.007, respectively. Compared to the values for conspecific population comparisons, I = 0.994 +/- 0.001 and D - 0.006 +/- 0.001, it is clear that a small but significant amount of genetic divergence separates the European and American lobster. Based on the premise that protein differences between existing species reflect the amount of time since they shared a common ancestor, it can be speculated that the European and American lobsters were isolated during the Pleistocene. The apparent weakness of reproductive isolating barriers suggests that these populations have evolved allopatrically. Finally, quantification of species' genetic differences, together with recent successes in interspecific laboratory matings, implicates species hybridization as a potentially important breeding practice in lobster aquaculture.", "pmid": "836910", "mesh_set": "D000818 D005075 D005060 D005787 D005796 D006579 D008121 D009656 D011506", "score": 7.4023056, "rank": 6127, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The conventional acid-ethanol technique combined with ethanol-ether purification gave high yields and a reproducible pattern of components. Large amounts of tissue were more easily extracted using another technique, based on extraction by boiling, extraction and precipitation with acetone, and--if necessary--salting out. By means of the latter two techniques mucosal tissue from all of the porcine gastrointestinal tract was extracted and subjected to gel filtration. Glucagon-like peptides were searched for using: 1. a radioimmunoassay which quantifies gut type glucagon (GTG), as well as pancreatic type glucagon (PTG), 2. a radioimmunoassay highly specific for pancreatic type glucagon (PTG), and 3. a radioreceptor assay based on binding of glucagon to porcine liver cell membranes. The oesophageal, the fundic, and the antro-pyloric parts of the gastric mucosa contained very small amounts of GLI. The cardiac gland region contained small amounts of a peptide indistinguishable from \"true\" glucagon.

{"title": "Electrophysiological evidence against negative neuronal feedback from the forebrain controlling midbrain raphe unit activity.", "abstract": "The hypothesis that the activity of serotonin (5-HT)-containing neurons of the midbrain raphe is subject to negative neuronal feedback regulation was examined. This hypothesis is based primarily on the observation that the administration of drugs which increase the synaptic availability of 5-HT depress midbrain raphe neuron discharge. Since the preponderance of midbrain raphe efferents are ascending, transections which interrupt both the main efferent outflow, as well as all inputs from anterior levels, ought to disrupt the functional integrity of a neuronal feedback loop. The effect of complete transections of the neuraxis placed just rostral to the midbrain raphe nuclei on the efficacy of two drugs which elevate synaptic serotonin, chlorimipramine and p-chloroamphetamine, was investigated in the chloral hydrate anesthetized rat. Such transections neither blocked nor attenuated the depressive effect of intravenously administered chlorimipramine (0.33 or 0.15 mg/kg) or p-chloroamphetamine (1.25 mg/kg) on midbrain raphe unit discharge. These results suggest that neuronal feedback involving the forebrain dose not mediate the depressive effect of drugs which elevate synaptic serotonin on midbrain raphe neuronal activity.

Small amounts of minced tissue were incubated for 2 h at 37 C in the presence of tracer F or E. After extraction, the steroids were chromatographed using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. From 11-21 weeks of gestation, inactivation of F to E occurred (54.7 +/- 8.0%), while in 11 premature infants there was no conversion in either direction and in 9 infants (4 months to 2 yr of age) there was slight conversion of E to F (7.0 +/- 3.4%).

Lung tissue from 4 anencephalics (35-40 + weeks) retained the ability to inactivate F to E (21.3 +/- 4.3%), though to a lesser extent (P less than 0.01) than fetuses up to 21 weeks. The validity of these in vitro studies was borne out by assays of the endogenous steroids in lung tissue and serum. These results suggest that there is an alteration from rapid inactivation of F to E in early fetal life to slight F production in infancy and that this change is advanced by pituitary or other factors which are decreased in anencephaly.

In healthy specimens the probes consistently failed to reach the apical termination of the junctional epithelium (x = -0.39 mm).

Therefore, experiments were performed in which the effect of amiloride on PD and ion transport was evaluated in the in vitro short-circuited human colon. In control periods the short-circuit current (Isc) was 2.9 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- S.E.M.) muEq per hr per cem2, while the corresponding net transfer of Na and Cl was 4.6 +/- 0.4 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 respectively. The residual flux was insignificantly different from zero. Amiloride caused a prompt, but reversible, decrease in Isc, PD, and conductance when added to the mucosal sie,dbut only a relatively small reduction of the mucosa to serosa fluxes of Na occurred. Bidirectional Cl fluxes were unchanged while the residual flux increased significantly.

{"title": "Effect of small bowel resection on the gastric mucosa in the rat.", "abstract": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (120 to 130 gm), unoperated, sham-operated, and those with a 50% resection of the proximal small intestine, were studied after periods of 3, 6, 9, or 12 months. Differences in body weight and in the surface area, thickness, volume, and cellular content of the gastric mucosa between these three groups of animals were compared and statistically analyzed. After an initial loss in body weight, animals with small bowel resection and sham-operated animals attained weights equivalent to unoperated controls. Comparison of the groups for mucosal surface areas of the body of the stomachs showed no significant differences at the 3-, 6-, or 9-month periods. However, 12 months after surgery, the mucosal surface area of stomachs from resected animals was significantly greater than in corresponding controls. At 3, 6, and 9 months after resection, the thickness and volume of the gastric mucosa and the epithelial cell populations (parietal and nonparietal) of the gastric glands were significantly greater than in controls. However, at 12 months, there was no significant difference in any of these parameters between the controls and the experimental animals. The DNA content of the gastric mucosa was significantly greater for animals with small bowel resection than for corresponding controls at 1 and 6 months after surgery. It is concluded that hyperplasia of the gastric glands exists for at least 9 months after proximal small bowel resection in the rat.

Simultaneously, the pharmacokinetics of clazepam were investigated. 2. While clazepam itself could be detected neither in plasma nor in urine, it gave rise to two plasma metabolites, the former, an alcoholic derivative with a short half-life, and the second, desmethyldiazepam, with a long half-life. These two metabolites and oxazepam were excreted in urine and, within the 24 h period following drug intake, accounted for 73% of the ingested dose. 3. Seven hours after its administration, clazepam slightly improved performance and reduced anxiety.

This effect was only observed when assayed in injected oocytes, while invitro assays of aminoacylation failed to detect differences between normal tRNA and tRNA from ethionine treated animals. The effect of ethionine on the tRNA population was not uniform and differed for various amino acid specific tRNAs. Thus liver tRNA from ethionine treated rats showed a decreased capacity for phenylalanine aminoacylation, while no change was found in the case of leucine. On the other hand, the level of histidine aminoacylation was higher for tRNA from ethionine treated animals. An even more complex response was observed with methionine aminoacylation where tRNA from ethionine treated animals showed an initially faster rate than control tRNA. With more prolonged incubation periods, the methionyl-tRNA from ethionine treated animals was deacylated at an accelerated rate while the level of normal methionyl-tRNA remained almost constant. In addition to the aminoacylation reaction, the participation of aminoacyl-tRNA in protein synthesis was severely impaired.

The competitive alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent labetalol, in concentrations up to 10(-4) M, produced dose-dependent increases in transmitter overflow from the isolated blood perfused spleen of the cat following nerve stimulation at 10 and 30 Hz. 2. At concentrations above 10(-4) M labetol produced a pronounced decrease in transmitter overflow. 3. Labetalol (1.5 X 10(-4) M) increased the recovery of 3H label in the venous blood following the close-arterial infusion of [3H]-(-)-noradrenaline indicating that the drug inhibits uptake of the amine. 4. Both labetalol (3.8 X 10(-5) M) and piperoxan (7.4 X 10(-6) M) produced parallel shifts to the right of the dose-response curves to noradrenaline and oxymetazoline in isolated strips of cat splenic capsule. In this preparation both drugs acted as competitive postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents. 5. Labetalol (3.3 X 10(-5) M) increased the transmitter overflow following stimulation of the splenic nerves with 200 impulses at 10 Hz. The overflow could be further increased by subsequent addition of piperoxan (7.2 X 10(-6 M). Piperoxan (5.7 X 10(-6) M) alone produced a marked increase in transmitter overflow which could be further increased by subsequent addition of desmethylimipramine (DMI; 3.2 X 10(-5) M). Cocaine (1.5 X 10(-5) M) or DMI (5.4 X 10(-5 M) produced a small increase in transmitter overflow which was not further increased by addition of labetalol (2.8 X 10(-5) M). 6. Labetalol produced a biphasic effect on the responses of the isolated blood perfused spleen of the cat to nerve stimulation. With low doses (up to 10(-4) M) vascular responses were potentiated and with high doses (greater than 10(-4) M) inhibited. The potentiation was related to uptake blockade and the inhibition to decreased transmitter overflow and postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. 7. Labetalol appears to act as a postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist in the isolated blood perfused spleen of the cat with little effect on presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. The moderate elevation of transmitter overflow by the drug is related to the inhibitory effect of the drug on neuronal uptake rather than on presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors.", "pmid": "15698", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002415 D004347 D004558 D004983 D066298 D007741 D009119 D018377 D009638 D010109 D010883 D013154 D013564 D009435 D013997", "score": 20.649105, "rank": 2016, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

SAMPLE 47 TPLO plates explanted from 45 client-owned dogs (22 cast plates from dogs with OSA, 22 cast plates from dogs without OSA, and 3 forged plates from dogs without OSA). PROCEDURES Histologic evaluations of tissue samples collected from implant sites at the time of plate retrieval were performed to confirm implant site tumor status of each dog. Surfaces and metallographic cross sections of retrieved plates were examined, and the microcell technique was used to obtain local electrochemical corrosion and ion release measurements. RESULTS Findings indicated that all cast SS plates demonstrated high spatial variability of their electrochemical surface properties and inhomogeneous superficial and cross-sectional composition, compared with forged plates. Greater metal ion release was observed in cast plates than in forged plates and in cast plates from dogs with OSA than in cast or forged from dogs without OSA. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that accumulation of metal ions from implants could be a trigger for neoplastic transformation in neighboring cells.

A method for measuring bidirectional Cl fluxes has been used to estimate net Cl movements in short-circuited frog skin and to compare these with the short-circuit current (Isc) and Na fluxes. 2. In some experiments bidirectional fluxes of both Na and Cl were measured simultaneously. It was found that the algebraic sum of the net fluxes of these two ions did not differ significantly from the values of Isc, either in untreated or catecholamine-treated skins, except for the half-hour period immediately after catecholamine addition. 3. The net effluxes of Cl produced by noradrenaline (1-6 X 10(-5)M), isoprenaline (8 X 10(-7)M) and adrenaline (6 and 15 X 10(-6)M) were of similar magnitude for each catecholamine. The magnitude of the Cl response measured as a flux ratio was related to a certain extent to the precatecholamine Cl conductance. 4. The net Na influx was increased by isoprenaline and reduced by noradrenaline. 5. Addition of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent oxprenolol (4-5 X 10(-5)M) to skins stimulated by catecholamine resulted in the disappearance of the net Cl movement and fall in skin conductance and Isc. This fall was similar in magnitude to, and correlated with the mean rise in Isc produced by isoprenaline, but of significantly greater magnitude in the case of noradrenaline. 6. The changes in Na influx were strongly associated with the changes in Isc following catecholamine addition. Similarly, the changes in Na efflux and Cl efflux were correlated, suggesting the Na fluxes to be dissociated, influx and efflux changes perhaps taking place at different loci. 7. Acetazolamide (1-2 X 10(-4)M), added either before or during the noradrenaline stimulation, had no effect on the Cl efflux response. 8. The tissue exchange of Cl from the outside bathing medium after 4 hr was greater in catecholamine-stimulated skins than in those in which the response had been blocked by oxprenolol. 9.

Effects due to intermediate doses were not affected, or were potentiated within about 30 min, following an initial inhibition. 2 The alpha-adrenoceptor blockers thus caused a shift to the right and an increase of the maximum height of log dose-response curves of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants. For a given dose of antagonist, the onset was slower for the potentiating than for the blocking effect. 3 The shift to the right induced by piperoxan and yohimbine on dose-response curves of noradrenaline and adrenaline was analysed with the Schild plot, and the slopes obtained, around 0.3, were lower than expected from receptor theory. When cocaine was used to block neuronal uptake, the slopes were close to 1.0. 4 The increase in maximum response to noradrenaline and adrenaline induced by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers was dependent on the time of incubation, on the dose of antagonist, and on the initial height of responses to the agonist. A less pronounced potentiation was also obtained when acetylcholine was used as agonist. 5 The findings are explained in terms of receptor theory as being due to a dual effect of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists; competitive antagonism proper, which may be disclosed after blockade of neuronal uptake, and an interaction at a different locus, which results in potentiation of the effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline.", "pmid": "3246", "mesh_set": "D000317 D000818 D004357 D004837 D008297 D051381 D011941 D014649 D015016", "score": 20.579588, "rank": 2040, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Myocardial ischemia and cell acidosis: Modification by alkali and the effects on ventricular function and cation composition.", "abstract": "Myocardial cell pH was measured with 5, 5 dimethyl-2, 4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) in intact anesthetized dogs by a transient indicator dilution technique. Bolus injections of labeled DMO, vascular, extracellular and water indicators were made into the left anterior descending coronary artery, and blood samples were collected from the great cardiac vein. The steady state distribution of DMO between cells and plasma was calculated from the mean transit times of the indicator. Normal myocardial cell pH averaged 6.94 and changed by 58% of the concomitant alterations in plasma pH after infusions of acid or alkali. Myocardial ischemia induced by inflation of a balloon tip catheter in the left anterior descending coronary artery resulted in progressive decreases in cell pH to 6.59 by 1 hour. Infusions of sodium carbonate diminished intracellular acidosis. Hemodynamic studies during 4 hours of ischemia with blood pH at 7.55 to 7.60 indicated a significantly reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increased stroke volume by comparison with findings in animals given infusions of saline solution. Ventriculograms revealed improved wall motion in the ischemic segment after infusion of alkali. Precordial mapping showed a significant reduction in the number of leads with S-T segment elevation as well as in the sum of S-T segment elevations, but R wave amplitudes did not differ from those in control studies. Calculations of extracellular space, tissue water and cation content revealed a reduced gain of cell sodium ion and loss of cell potassium ion during ischemia after alkali treatment. The latter may account for the S-T segment responses, whereas enhanced ventricular performance may be related to reduced competition of hydrogen ion with calcium ion for binding sites on contractile protein.", "pmid": "3959", "mesh_set": "D000138 D000468 D000818 D001834 D002254 D002414 D003327 D003331 D004114 D004285 D004492 D005110 D006321 D006863 D007201 D009206", "score": 13.465894, "rank": 5276, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In rats not poisoned with lead, neither vitamin E nor selenium deficiency affected spleen weight, hematocrit value, or erythrocyte mechanical fragility. Vitamin E deficiency increased the splenomegaly, anemia, and mechanical fragility of red cells of lead-poisoned rats, whereas selenium deficiency did not. Addition of 0.5 ppm selenium to the vitamin E-supplemented diet increased slightly the splenomegaly and anemia in lead-poisoned rats. Excess levels of selenium (2.5 and 5 ppm) in the vitamin E-deficient diet had little or no effect on spleen size or hematocrit of rats not receiving lead, but partially prevented the splenomegaly and anemia of red cells from either non-poisoned or lead-oisoned vitamin E-deficient rats, but not as effectively as vitamin E. These results show that vitamin E status of rats is more important that selenium status in determining response to toxic levels of lead.

When the drug was administered during water diuresis, solute-free water formation was unchanged associated with a peak increment in fractional sodium excretion of approximately 15% of filtered load. However, studies performed in hydropenic subjects demonstrated a virtual abolition of free water reabsorption. The diuretic caused a mild phosphaturia which did not appear to be related to alterations in parathyroid hormone. Furthermore, whereas net hydrogen ion excretion and urinary pH were unchanged, the excretion of ammonium ion, titratable acidity and bicarbonate all increased mildly. Taken together, the data suggest that the primary site of action of bumetanide is the medullary portion of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, but that in addition, bumetanide inhibits the transport of sodium in the proximal nephron. Despite the fact that the drug is a sulfonamide derivative, its proximal activity seems unrelated to a carbonic anhydrase inhibitory effect.

Additive or synergistic effects on microsomal cytochrome P-450 content were seen when methadone consumption was supplemented by administration of maximally inducing doses of either 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or phenobarbital (PB). This suggested that there was an increase in a type of cytochrome P-450 which was independent of that induced by PB or 3-MC. The qualitative change in cytochrome P-450 reflected in the ethylisocyanide binding spectrum was also apparent after treatment with methadone, PB, or 3-MC, and the combination of methadone and PB exhibited effects that differed from PB alone. Two-substrate kinetic analysis with methadone and morphine as substrates indicated that more than one enzymic system may be involved in the N-demethylation reaction and that a common component of this N-demethylase system could not be induced with phenobarbital.

The activity of HMM is higher and the zone of the neutral suppression is diminished at low ionic strength, the activation by the modifiers being observed at the significantly lesser degree. CaATPase activation by dinitrophenol, octanol and toluene is suggested to be of the same nature and is accounted for the masking of \"the inhibiting\" ionizable group of the enzyme with near to neutral pK.

{"title": "Activation by phosphate of yeast phosphofructokinase.", "abstract": "The activity of yeast phosphofructokinase assayed in vitro at physiological concentrations of known substrates and effectors is 100-fold lower than the glycolytic flux observed in vivo. Phosphate synergistically with AMP activates the enzyme to a level within the range of the physiological needs. The activation by phosphate is pH-dependent: the activation is 100-fold at pH 6.4 while no effect is observed at pH 7.5. The activation by AMP, phosphate, or both together is primarily due to changes in the affinity of the enzyme for fructose-6-P. Under conditions similar to those prevailing in glycolysing yeast (pH 6.4, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM NH4+) the apparent affinity constant for fructose-6-P (S0.5) decreases from 3 to 1.4 mM upon addition of 1 mM AMP or 10 mM phosphate; if both activators are present together, S0.5 is further decreased to 0.2 mM. In all cases the cooperativity toward fructose-6-P remains unchanged. These results are consistent with a model for phosphofructokinase where two conformations, with different affinities for fructose-6-P and ATP, will present the same affinity for AMP and phosphate. AMP would diminish the affinity for ATP at the regulatory site and phosphate would increase the affinity for fructose-6-P.

Mean peak levels are 23 microng/ml after an oral pirprofen dose of 200 mg; lower doses given proportionally lower levels. Administration 1 hr after a meal slightly delays the peak plasma level, but the extent of absorption is not affected significantly. Administration of pirprofen, 150 mg, 4 times daily, or 200 mg, 3 times daily, results in nearly identical plasma levels at steady-state. Pirprofen has an apparent elimination half-life of about 7 hr. The results obtained from a 200-mg pirprofen-14C dose indicate that excretion of the drug occurs primarily by the renal route in the form of metabolites and is essentially complete within 24 hr.

A multifunctional drug delivery system (DDS) was designed in this work for effective targeting delivery of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) as an autophagy inhibitor. The ZIF-8 nanoparticles encapsulating CQ (CQ@ZIF-8 NPs) were fabricated by a simple one-pot method and were then decorated with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (FA-PEG), a special identifier of cancer cells, to form FA-PEG/CQ@ZIF-8. The target identification of FA-PEG/CQ@ZIF-8 NPs, compared with CQ@ZIF-8 NPs, leads to an increasing number of NPs being internalized into HeLa cells, which decreases the loss of drugs and results in high cytotoxicity of CQ for cancer cells. The lower viabilities of HeLa cells (cancer cells) and higher viabilities of HEK293 cells (healthy cells) treated with FA-PEG/CQ@ZIF-8 NPs show that the special target for cancer cells results from the combinations of folic acid and folate receptors on the surface of HeLa cells. The quantitative measurements of autophagy-related proteins and the detection of autophagy flux in HeLa cells suggest that the autophagosome formation and autophagy flux are appreciably blocked after the cells are treated with FA-PEG/CQ@ZIF-8 NPs. The ZIF-8 can disintegrate only under low pH conditions, resulting in fast and full release of CQ. The pH-responsive and tumor-targeted properties of the NPs can control the drug release and enhance the efficiency of autophagy inhibition. It indicates that the FA-PEG/CQ@ZIF-8 NPs combining target identification with controlled drug release can be used as a novel model for discussing targeted cancer therapy and inhibiting the autophagy of cancer cells.", "pmid": "30151542", "mesh_set": "D001343 D002470 D002738 D016503 D065546 D005492 D057809 D006367 D006801 D000073396 D053758 D011092 D017641 D015032", "score": 18.309877, "rank": 2921, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Upon phosphorylcholine addition, IgM FR exhibited 83% enhancement of the tryptophanyl fluorescence, which was associated with a red shift of the emission maximun (5nm). The same properties were observed with the 7S IgM subunits. The association constant KA for phosphorylcholine was 6X10(4) M-1 FOR IgM FR and the 7S subunit, as determined by fluorescence titration, a value in agreement with the obtained by equilibrium dialysis. No significant decrease in the KA value was found in the presence of 3 M urea; in 6 M urea, the increase in fluorescence intensity was 36% of the value obtained in the absence of denaturing agent. In contrast, only 4% of fluorescence enhancement was noted upon binding in 3 M GuHC1 and no enhancement could be seen when the concentration of  GuHC1 was increased to 5 M, thus suggesting complete unfolding of the protein and subsequent loss of binding activity. The pH dependence study of the phosphorylcholine binding to IgM FR indicated no significant differences in the fluorescence enhancement between pH 5 and 8, whereas at more acidic or alkaline pH values, the enhancement became smaller. At pH 3.0 and 10.0, no enhancement was seen suggesting no binding of the ligand, a fact confirmed independently by equilibrium dialysis. When the spectroscopic properties of the IgM FR were compared with those of murine myeloma proteins that bind the same ligand large differences were recorded in the amplitude of the  phosphorylcholine induced enhancement of the fluorescnece and in the shift of the emission maximum wavelength.

The ligand dependent dissociation data were fit well by a simple sequential model. The data for CO and oxyhemoglobin are consistent with Hb12 leads to 2Hb6 leads to 12Hb. Methemoglobin at pH 7 appears to be hexameric and the dissociation is consistent with the model: Hb6 leads to 6Hb. In a sequential decay scheme for which light-scattering changes are monitored, the relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as well as the molecular weights of intermediate species. Assignment of the hexameric intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates. This assignment is further supported by the following: (1) the same model will fit the data for oxy- and CO-hemoglobin at all three temperatures (a 24-29-fold variation in rate constants), (2) evidence from electron microscopy shows hexameric forms, and (3) methemoglobin is apparently stable as a hexamer at pH 7.

Choline caused an augmentation of the adrenomedullary response to each of the treatments, but it had no apparent effect on a presynaptic enzyme, choline acetyltransferase.

MNNG (1 mM) increased colonic mucosal cGMP from 1.8 +/- 0.2 to 22.5 +/- 2.7 pmol/mg protein in 5 minutes. Increases in response to MNNG occurred in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, whereas the two-fold increase in mucosal cGMP mediated by carbamylcholine was abolished by exclusion of Ca2+. Although GC activity of mucosal homogenates was found predominantly (90%) in the 100,000 g particulate fraction, the effects of MNNG on mucosal cGMP correlated with stimulation of 100,000 g soluble GC by this agonist. MNNG increased soluble GC 13-fold over the corresponding basal with 4 mM Mn2+, and 48-fold with 4 mM Mg2+ as the sole available divalent cation. Compared with unstimulated GC, the MNNG-activated soluble enzyme was less dependent upon Mn2+ availability and effectively utilized Mg2+ as metal co-factor. N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl group alkylator, inhibited MNNG stimulation of GC and cGMP. Thus, expression of these MNNG actions may involve drug interaction with tissue thiol groups. Prior incubation of MNNG with thiol antioxidants or ascorbate also suppressed MNNG stimulation of GC, possibly through direct drug reactions involving nucleophilic and electrophilic reactants.

The loss of enzymic activity was closely associated with the destruction of tryptophan residues in the enzyme. Significant protection of both enzymic activity and tryptophanyl residues in the enzyme molecule was achieved by performing the photo-oxidation in the presence of maltose, which is a substrate for the enzyme.

A Valsalva-like manoeuvre was used to elicit graded rises in total peripheral resistance (TPR) in conscious rabbits. The rises were reflex and mediated through sympathetic constrictors. Propranolol infused at different rates reaching plasma concentrations up to 240 (SEM 33) ng/ml had no effect on this reflex but reduced mean arterial pressure. However, the response was attenuated by clonidine in a dose-dependent manner. 2. Valsalva manoeuvres were used to elicit graded sympathetically mediated rises in TPR index in twenty-nine subjects with mean arterial pressure ranging from 75 to 165 mmHg. Absolute sensitivity of the constrictor response increased with rising resting TPR index, resulting in some enhancement of constrictor responses in the hypertensive subjects.

{"title": "Relationship between changes in intraluminal pressure and transmural potential difference in the human and canine jejunum in vivo.", "abstract": "Recordings of transmural potential difference (PD) across the jejunum of conscious man in situ are characterised by spontaneous fluctuations of up to 10 mV. In 25 of 31 subjects (comprising seven normal controls and 24 patients under investigation for malabsorption, six of whom had coeliac disease) we observed a clear association between these fluctuations and changes in intraluminal pressure recorded at the same site. The most frequent PD changes were associated with type III pressure waves. These consisted predominantly of large waver (3-1 +/- 0-1 mV; mean +/- SEM, n = 317) which reached maximal amplitude approximately 45 seconds after the pressure peak and had a duration of 120 +/- 3 s, but also included less frequent spikes (0-5 +/- 0-1 mV; n = 110) concurrent with the pressure wave with a duration of 5 +/- 1 s. Although by recording at two sites in the jejunum 10 cm apart we were able to demonstrate that type III pressure waves appeared to be propagated aborally at a median rate of 60 cm per minute, the apparent rates of propagation of the corresponding PD waves were much more variable. The largest PD changes (7-8 +/- 0-4 mV; n = 19), lasting several minutes, were found in association with runs of type I waves (basic rhythm) superimposed on a type III wave. Both pressure and PD activities were suppressed by intramuscular propantheline bromide. Intraluminal pilocarpine caused a transient rise in PD not always accompanied by a change in pressure. Distention of the jejunum by rapid injection of a bolus of isotonic sodium chloride produced a delayed rise in the PD which could be prevented by prior administration of propantheline bromide. Experiments using Thirty-Vella loops of proximal jejunum in conscious dogs confirmed the effect of jejunal distension on the PD and also demonstrated that spontaneous retching is preceded by an increase in the PD. Consideration of these results in conjunction with data from other workers suggests the hypothesis that the larger spontaneous fluctuations in transmural PD in the jejunum of conscious man are caused by changes in electrogenic secretion associated with intestinal motility and mediated by cholinergic mechanisms. The possible association of increased secretory activity with motility may have functions of lubrication as well as diluting and mixing the chyme for easier digestion and absorption.", "pmid": "856673", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004285 D004594 D005769 D006801 D007583 D008286 D011312", "score": 12.659118, "rank": 5568, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The binding protein of Aspergillus nidulans showed a set of properties which is unique for tubulin. Binding occurred rapidly at 4 degrees C and was competitively inhibited by oncodazole and colchicine. Other inhibitors of microtubule function such as podophyllotoxin, vinblastine sulfate, melatonin, and griseofulvin did not interfere with binding of MBC. Electrophoretic analysis of partially purified preparations of the binding protein revealed the presence of proteins with similar mobilities as mammalian tubulin monomers. Hence it is concluded that the binding protein is identical with fungal tubulin. The effect of MBC on mycelial growth of mutant strains of A. nidulans was positively correlated with the affinity of the binding sites for this compound. The apparent binding constant for MBC and tubulin from a wild type was estimated at 4.5 X 10(5), from a resistant strain at 3.7 X 10(4), and from a strain with increased sensitivity to MBC at 1.6 X 10(6) liters/mol. Mutants showing resistance and increased sensitivity to MBC are candidates to have alterations in tubulin structure. Affinity of tubulin for MBC is probably a common mechanism of resistance to this compound in fungi.

After the ischemic period the hearts were perfused in a retrograde non-working way for 30 min. Flow rates, glycogen, ATP, and creatine-phosphate went down during the time of ischemia, whereas tissue lactate accumulated. For shorter periods of ischemia these values were normalized but after 30 min of ischemia the hearts seemed to be irreversibly damaged. There was a leakage of GOT, GPT, LDH, and CPK from all hearts when ischemic from 5 to 30 min. Different factors that might be of importance for the degree of ischemic injury were tested. The injury tended to be more severe at higher heart rates. Addition of adrenaline 10(-6)M resulted in excessive myocardial damage. A variation of pH from 7.1 to 7.7 did not alter the effects of the ischemic injury. One group of rats were injected with adrenaline for 8 weeks to simulate chronic stress. When hearts from these rats were made ischemic they were more prone to fail compared to controls. The failing hearts, on the other hand, had a lower leakage of enzymes, possibly due to a less severe myocardial damage.

The effects of Iso and Pap on the concentration-action curves of the contractions by K, ACh, Ba and exogenous Ca(Table II) suggest that the parallel shift to the right of the curves of K, ACh and Ba is due to the functional antagonism between the antispasmodics and the mobilization of Ca produced by the contracting agents.", "pmid": "10235", "mesh_set": "D000109 D000818 D001464 D002118 D004140 D004305 D006168 D006632 D006634 D007082 D066298 D007545 D009119 D009130 D010208 D010276 D011188", "score": 15.4784, "rank": 4340, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Preincubation of the enzyme with isocitrate and Mg2+ abolishes this lag phase, the steady-state rate being reached at once. It is suggested that the enzyme exists in at least two conformational forms with different activities, and that the lag phase represents the transition (k = 0.4s-1) from a form with low activity to the fully active enzyme, induced by the binding of isocitrate and Mg2+.", "pmid": "27171", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002417 D007521 D007523 D007700 D008274 D008929 D009249", "score": 19.434267, "rank": 2460, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The latter condition was achieved by permanently keeping the rats on essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) food. Indomethacin inhibited the carrageenin-oedema in normal rats, but failed to further suppress the poorly developed delayed phase of the carrageenin-induced inflammation in EFAD rats. In contrast, aspirin exhibited equal inhibition of the carrageenin oedema in both normal and EFAD rats. The anti-inflammatory effect of dexamethasone was also indentical in both normal and EFAD rats. Since in EFAD rats the inflammatory role of an increased output of prostaglandins is of negligible importance, the results with aspirin and dexamethasone shed some doubt on such views, that suppression of the release of prostaglandins alone explains the acute anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs. The inflammatory response of EFAD rats is a model situation appearing to be useful in studying anti-inflammatory mechanisms which, under normal conditions, might be masked by interference with the release of prostaglandins.", "pmid": "272845", "mesh_set": "D000818 D000893 D001241 D002351 D003907 D005228 D007213 D007249 D008297 D009929 D011453 D051381", "score": 20.30308, "rank": 2151, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Procaine was more effective in inhibiting serotonin oxidation than phenylethylamine oxidation and had an intermediate effect on tryptamine oxidation. MAO activity in tissue homogenates from rats treated with procaine (150 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was inhibited most in liver, less in heart, and only very slightly brain for a duration of up to 8 hours. Procaine injected in that dose did not alter brain norepinephrine levels and elevated only slightly the brain serotonin levels. It did not protect against the degradation of exogenous radioactive tryptamine in brain. These data confirm and extend prior observations on in vitro inhibition of MAO by procaine and suggest that in high doses procaine may inhibit MAO weakly in vivo.

PIF was tested both in vivo and on pituitary incubates. Fractions were also assayed after adsorption of their catecholamine content on alumina, as well as in presence of haloperidol or alpha-flupentixol, potent DA receptor inhibitors. In the MBH, PIF was evenly distributed in the 17,000 g supernatant (S2) and in the crude mitochondrial fraction (P2) which contains synaptosomes. PIF activity was completely removed by alumina adsorption of S2, but not of P2 in spite of an over 99.9% elimination of DA. In contrast, striatal PIF activity was detected only in P2, and disappeared completely upon alumina adsorption, thus indicating that, in this structure, it is entirely due to DA. Addition of haloperidol (10--5M) or alpha-flupentixol (10--6M) reduced PIF activity of crude MBH homogenates, but no longer affected it after alumina adsorption. Quantitative studies suggest that only half of the total MBH PIF activity is accounted for by DA.

No inhibitory action was observed with any of these prostaglandins and in fact a slight stimulation of Na transport was seen under some circumstances. We conclude that the natriuresis which follows in vivo administration of some prostaglandins is not the result of a direct inhibition of Na reabsorption at the contraluminal pump site and is most likely secondary to renal vasodilation. We also studied net and isotopic Na fluxes in human erythrocytes. Na transport was not affected by prostaglandins of the E, A or F series using both normal and high sodium erythrocytes.

The response to an increase in PICO2 from 0.3 to 5.2 mm Hg was a five-fold increase in gill ventilation volume and a slight increase in breathing frequency. There was a concomitant rise in PACO2 and an immediate fall in pHa. If PICO2 was maintained at 5.2 mm Hg for several days, ventilation volume gradually returned to the initial, prehypercapnic level within three days. Arterial pH also returned to the initial level within 2-3 days. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that under these conditions fish regulate pH via HCO3/C1 exchange across the gills rather than by changes in ventilation and subsequent adjustment of PACO2. A reduction in environmental pH causes a reduction in pHa but only a slow gradual increase in VG. Injections of HC1 or NaHCO3 into the blood have opposite effects on pHa but both cause a marked increase in VG.

{"title": "Reduction of tertiary amine N-oxides by rat liver mitochondria.", "abstract": "Reduction of tertiary amine N-oxides by the mitochondrial fraction of rat liver was investigated. NADPH was required as a cofactor. The rate of reaction was faster with the NADPH-generating system than with NADPH. Isocitrate in the NADPH-generating system revealed the maximum stimulation. A little less activity was observed when NADH was used as a cofactor instead of NADPH. The reductase activity was markedly inhibited under aerobic conditions. The rates of mitochondrial tertiary amine N-oxide reduction expressed in nanomoles per milligram of protein per minute were: N,N-dimethylaniline N-oxide, 4.3; tiaramide N-oxide, 0.47; and imipramine N-oxide, 0.14. The activity for N,N-dimethylaniline N-oxide was comparable to the microsomal activity, but the activity for imipramine N-oxide was much less than that in microsomes. Isocitrate and alpha-ketoglutarate were found to stimulate mitochondrial tertiary amine N-oxide reduction more efficiently than other Krebs cycle intermediates. Oxalacetate, on the other hand, was the least effective intermediate. ATP together with NADPH and NADP stimulated the reaction efficiently, probably due to the energy-dependent intramitochondrial transhydrogenation.

Un physiological, 1,3-diaminopropane depressed most effectively the activity of ornithine decarboxylase. It depressed also the activity of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, which was not inhibited by other amines. The activity of tyrosine aminotransferase was invariably stimulated by injection of the amines. Cycloheximide caused a rapid decay of the activity of liver ornithine decarboxylase (half-life 15 min) and also a decay of the activity of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (half-life 36 min). 1,3-Diaminopropane inhibited the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (half-life 13 min) and to lesser extent also the activity of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (half-life 120 min). On the contrary, alpha-amanitin did not have any effect on the activity of the decarboxylases. These experiments are consistent with the view that diamines and spermidine might conceivably control the activity of ornithine decarboxylase in regenerating rat liver in vivo at steps beyond transcription. It is also possible that 1,3-diaminopropane similarly controls the activity of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase thus suggesting that the synthesis of ornithine and adenosylmethionine decarboxylases may be coordinatively regulated in liver.", "pmid": "842265", "mesh_set": "D012437 D000546 D000588 D000818 D002262 D003513 D003864 D003959 D008099 D008115 D009955 D051381", "score": 20.205873, "rank": 2177, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

This diminution of the in-vivo Bohr effect at the muscle tissue level during exercise in diabetics was due to a significantly smaller decrease of venous blood pH (down to 7.33 vs. 7.27 in normals; P less than 0.05), probably a consequence of an latered muscle metabolism in insulin deficiency. Although no glucose was taken up, even during exercise, and less lactate was produced by insulin-deficient muscle (P less than 0.05), the differences in venous blood pH appeared to be brought about mainly by a different CO2 production of the exercising muscle in the two groups. The response of Krebs cycle activity to exercise in insulin-deficient muscle might have been inadequate, as suggested by the increased 3-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio in the venous blood observed in the normal controls but not in the diabetics. Furthermore, proportionally less of the arterial ketone body concentration was utilized by the working muscle in the insulin-deficient diabetics.

Hemodynamic changes elicited by intravenously administered K\u00f6 1366 (0.05 mg/Kg) were correlated with age, cardiac index, and electrocardiographic findings, respectively. With reference to age in normotensive subjects, K\u00f6 1366 caused no significant differences in rate of changes of various hemodynamic items between 3 age groups. Normotensive elderly subjects were divided into 3 groups according to cardic index. Cardiac index decreased greatly in high cardiac index group, slightly in normal cardiac index group, whereas it increased greatly in low cardiac index group. Stroke volume index showed the same tendency as cardiac index. Hypertensive elderly subjects were, also divided into 2 groups according to cardiac index. Again, cardiac index decreased in higher cardiac index group, while it increased in lower cardiac index group, though a statistical evaluation showed only a tendency of significant difference between 2 groups.

{"title": "Balloon-induced right ventricular outflow obstruction: a new approach to control of acute interventricular shunting after myocardial infarction in canines and swine.", "abstract": "Current management of ventricular septal defect (VSD) after myocardial infarction (MI) is aimed at improving left ventricular (LV) performance by afterload reduction as a means of hemodynamic stabilization or shunt control. The current investigation was undertaken to determine whether primary manipulation of right venticular (RV) performance by afterload enhancement was an effective means of reducing MI-VSD shunting. In five open-chest dogs an external LV-RV shunt was created with pulmonary-systemic flow ratios (Qp/Qs) averaging 2.26:1. Inflation of a balloon-tipped catheter in the main pulmonary artery (PA) reduced average QP/Qs to 1.28:1 and shunt flow from 783 to 343 ml/min. However, this increase in RV afterload caused further significant increases in RV systolic and end-diastolic pressure and suggested that deterioration of RV function might be limiting the usefulness of this technique. To investigate whether inotropic support for the RV would overcome this limitation, a similar shunt was created in 11 open-chest swine. We then investigated the effects of dopamine, infused at 24, 60, and 120 mug/min, on QP/QS and other hemodynamic variables both with and without PA balloon inflation. Optimal shunt control was obtained when effects of dopamine were added to those of PA balloon inflation. Shunt flow that had been 1,633 ml/min was reduced to 892 ml/min with the PA balloon and reduced further to 757 ml/min with dopamine, which also lowered RV and LV end-diastolic pressure and reduced total systemic vascular resistance. In four other swine with left anterior descending ligations, PA balloon inflation and dopamine infusion again favorably affected hemodynamics. Epicardial mapping in these swine showed an increase in S-T segment displacement, suggesting that the cumulative effect of these interventions allowed hemodynamic improvement at the expense of enhanced ischemic injury. These data indicate that acute RV outflow obstruction with a balloon catheter is an effective means of temporarily reducing acute ventricular shunting and that dopamine may be a useful pharmacological agent to use with RV afterload manipulation to stabilize a patient prior to transfer to a medical center for more definitive therapy.", "pmid": "844150", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001794 D002404 D004195 D004285 D004298 D005260 D006345 D006439 D008297 D008722 D009203 D011651 D013552", "score": 15.366009, "rank": 4403, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

There was an enhancement of the biliary elimination of 14C in the first 5 h after salicylate and a decrease in 14C concentration in blood; the proportion of warfarin to its metabolites excreted in the urine and bile was unchanged. Salicylate displaced serum protein bound [14C]warfarin in vitro. Salicylate increases the initial biliary elimination of warfarin by displacing some of that bound to plasma protein.

The amount of carbohydrates absorbed in total or per unit intestinal weight seemed to vary with changes in the number of absorptive cells. It is suggested that reduced absorption in PPD pups is primarily related to the smaller number of absorptive cells in these young.

Modification of human RBC with 50--350 U VCN/10(10) RBC for one hour at 37 degrees C releases 90-100% of the NANA and produces a progressive decrease towards zero in their electrophoretic mobilities when measured in 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.2) at 25 degrees C. The appearance of positive groups on the desialylated cells was indicated by the VCN-treated cells displaying positive mobilities below approximately pH 5.5 and increased negative mobilities at approximately pH 9 as well as substantial increases in their mobility at neutral pH following treatment with formaldehyde. Adsorption of about 95% of the VCN activity at 0 degrees C to the RBC did not produce any significant change in their electrophoretic mobilities thus indicating that the observed changes in the electrophoretic properties of the RBC following VCN treatment could not be attributable to adsorption of VCN.

Adenine alone had no effect. When the ethionine plus adenine injections were continued for longer periods of time, liver tRNA-methylating enzyme activity measured in vitro gradually increased and exceeded that of the controls. Concurrently, the relative methyl deficiency of liver tRNA decreased. The latter was evident because of the decreased ability of the tRNA to accept methyl groups during in vitro methylation catalyzed by homologous enzymes. Liver tRNA from animals that were treated with ethionine for 7 days could accept only about 40% as many methyl groups as could tRNA from animals that had received ethionine for only 2 days. No further significant change in methyl deficiency of the tRNA was seen when ethionine administration was extended to a total of 14 days.

The population density of secretory granules of the rats treated once with alkali first increased and then decreased reaching that of the fasted group, while that of the repeatedly treated group remained nearly equal to the maximum value. The average sectioned surface area of secretory granules tended to decrease for 1.5 h after the stimulation but the differences was not significant among those groups. From the results obtained at present, responding to chemical stimulation such as pH changes in the antrum, it seems probable that not only exocytosis but also migration of secretory granules from supra- and/or para-nuclear portion to the basal portion of the cell occurs rapidly in G-cells and that both these processes are inhibited immediately by antral acidification. Moreover, the present results apparently indicate that under the condition of no antral acidification G-cells have a capacity of secreting gastrin for a fairly long time, such as 4--8 h, responding to adequate stimulus.

{"title": "Multiple changes in distal stop-flow electrolyte patterns and reduction of acid excretion induced in rabbits by angiotensin.", "abstract": "1. Angiotensin has previously been shown to inhibit distal renal tubular sodium reabsorption. As a consequence of this, or independently, it might influence the distal handling of other electrolytes. We have therefore examined the effects of angiotensin on the distal reabsorption or secretion of a spectrum of electrolytes. 2. Standard bilateral stop-flow studies were done on anaesthetized, adrenalectomized rabbits, in which the effects of intravenous infusions of either 0-02-0-05 mug min-1 kg-1 or 1 mug min-1 kg-1 of angiotensin were compared with control stop-flow results. 3. The lower dose of angiotensin inhibited distal sodium, chloride, water and magnesium reabsorption, inhibited distal hydrogen secretion and stimulated distal potassium secretion. The higher dose of angiotensin produced these changes and additionally inhibited distal calcium reabsorption. Most of the observed changes were dose-related. The low dose of angiotensin did not significantly raise blood pressure but the high dose was pressor. 4. Changes in the stop-flow patterns induced by the higher dose of angiotensin were compatible with, and may help to explain, the changes it produced in urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium and calcium in clearance studies before stop-flow. Suppression of hydrogen secretion caused by both doses of angiotensin in the stop-flow studies was also reflected by reductions in acid excretion produced by these infusion rates in additional experiments performed by clearance methods in acid-loaded, conscious rabbits. 5.

Compared to the fed controls, glucagon reduced hepatic fatty acid synthesis and acetyl CoA carboxylase activity by 62% and 65% in fed rats, and by 51% and 48%, respectively, in refed rats. In contrast, glucagon had no effect on fatty acid synthesis or acetyl CoA carboxylase activity in adipose tissue of any of the three experimental groups. Exogenous insulin antagonized the glucagon effects and restored hepatic fatty acid synthesis and enzyme activity in fed or refed rats. No glucagon or insulin effects were observed in fasting rats. In addition, glucagon reduced in vivo incorporation of acetate into hepatic cholesterol by about 33% and into fatty acids of the liver, and heart and the kidney by 33%, 77% and 30%, respectively.

{"title": "Nature of interaction of dextran sulfate with lecithin dispersions and lysolecithin micelles.", "abstract": "Lecithin and lecithin/cholesterol dispersions as well as lysolecithin micelles were used to provide basic information on the mechanism of the interaction of zwitterionic phospholipids with dextran sulfate. The addition of dextran sulfate to lecithin dispersions or lysolecithin micelles in the presence of Ca2+ produced insoluble complexes. At each Ca2+ concentration, the amount of insoluble complex formed was maximal at the equivalence dextran sulfate/phospholipid weight ratio. An increase in CaCl2 concentration up to 10 mM progressively increased the equivalence ratios for the phospholipids. Further increase in Ca2+ concentration did not influence the equivalence ratio for maximal complex formation. The conversion of lecithin dispersions into insoluble complexes was very effective even at low Ca2+ concentrations. Approximately 70% of the lecithin was converted to the insoluble complex at CaCl2 concentrations as low as 0.5 mM and the complete conversion was observed at CaCl2 concentrations above 2.5 mM. In the presence of cholesterol, the precipitation curve for insoluble complex formation became broader than that of lecithin alone, indicating the enhancing effect of cholesterol on the insoluble complex formation both below and above the equivalence ratio. The stoichiometry of the interaction of the zwitterionic phospholipids with dextran sulfate inthe presence of calcium was determined using lysolecithin micelles. At the CaCl2 concentrations above 20 mM, the insoluble complex possessed a ratio of lysolecithin/calcium/sulfate group of approximately 2/1/3 (mol/mol/mol). It appears that the formation of the insoluble complex of lecithin or lysolecithin with dextran sulfate represents the mutually enhancing interactions involving both positive and negative charges of the zwitterionic phospholipids. These are the direct electro static interaction between the phospholipid choline nitrogen and the sulfate groups of dextran sulfate and the calcium cross-linking of the phosphate groups to the sulfate groups or to the phosphate groups of neighboring phospholipids.", "pmid": "838715", "mesh_set": "D001665 D002118 D003102 D003911 D007700 D008244 D008823 D009994 D010713 D013464", "score": 15.618095, "rank": 4263, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

This intrinsic factor 'receptor' was further purified by precipitation with 30% saturated ammonium sulphate, centrifugation at 105000 g, and filtration through Sephadex G-200. Failure to precipitate the receptor following centrifugation at 105000 g for 3 h and filtration of the receptor with the included volumes through Sepharose 4B and 6B was evidence that it was solubilized. The purification of the receptor was monitored by a radiometric assay where the intrinsic factor-[57Co]vitamin-B12 complex coupled to the solubilized receptor precipitated at 15% sodium sulphate while intrinsic factor-[57Co]B12 alone remained soluble at this salt concentration. This radioassay also permitted the in vitro study of the interaction of the solubilized receptor and intrinsic factor saturated with [57Co]B12. The receptor did not bind intrinsic factor-[57Co]B12 below pH 5 while binding was observed to pH 9.0. Binding was equivalent at 37 degrees C and 25 degrees C, but was markedly reduced at 4 degrees C and 56 degrees C and was destroyed at 100 degrees C. The receptor resisted 60 min of digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase and subtilisin. After 180 min digestion, pronase and subtilisin inactivated 90% and 41% of the receptor respectively, whereas trypsin and chymotrypsin inactivated only 21% and 23%. Trisodium EDTA inhibited the binding of intrinsic factor-[57Co]B12 to the receptor and this inhibition could be reversed by the addition of excess Ca2+. Mg2+ and Mn2+ were less effective than Ca2+ for the activity of the receptor. Kinetic analysis of the reaction indicated a maximum velocity of 0.083 nmole IF bound B12/min with a Km of 1.36 x 10(-10) M. The solubilized receptor had a greater affinity for intrinsic factor bound to vitamin B12 than for intrinsic factor free of vitamin B12.

{"title": "Inhibition of the intracellular release of calcium by Dantrolene in barnacle giant muscle fibres.", "abstract": "1. Ca movements in resting and in activated single giant muscle fibres of the barnacle were analysed before and after exposure to Dantrolene Na, a synthetic hydantoin derivative. 2. In fibres micro-injected with the photoprotein aequorin, the resting rate of light emission (resting glow) reversibly decreased upon exposure to Dantrolene. Similar results were obtained if the fibre had first been equilibrated in a O Ca-1 mM-EGTA medium. 3. The influx of 45Ca into resting muscle fibres was not modified by 35 micronM Dantrolene which also failed to significantly reduce the influx of 45Ca into muscle fibres which had been depolarized by exposure to external solutions in which K+ had been increased to 60 or 200 mM. 4. In fibres micro-injected with 45Ca, the calcium efflux was reversibly decreased by Dantrolene. This effect was still observed in O Ca medium and in O Ca-ONa medium. A possible effect of Dantrolene on the Na-Ca exchange process at the outer membrane was excluded by showing that when the direction of the Ca2+ movement was inverted in aequorin-loaded fibres by the sudden removal of Na+ from the external medium, a marked increase in the resting glow was recorded which was not affected by exposure to Dantrolene. 5. It is argued that the reduction of Ca2+ efflux by Dantrolene does not result from any direct inhibitory effect on the metabolically driven Ca pump at the outer membrane, but that it is rather related to the reduction of the concentration of myoplasmic Ca2+ which is indeed demonstrated by the reduced resting glow. This in turn is thought to result from a shift in the balance between Ca2+ movements into and out of the intracellular storage sites, and namely the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). 6. The Ca2+ transient in aequorin-loaded fibres and the force of the isometric contraction elicited by imposed membrane depolarizations were markedly reduced by Dantrolene. The electrochemical threshold for eliciting intracellular Ca2+ release was not significantly modified. The linear relation between membrane depolarization and Ca2+ transient became less steep. The process of sequestration of myoplasmic Ca2+ back into SR was not significantly affected by Dantrolene which appeared to inhibit rather selectively the Ca2+ release from SR into the cytosol.", "pmid": "850208", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001693 D002118 D002462 D003620 D006827 D066298 D007700 D008564 D009132 D012519 D001468", "score": 27.336403, "rank": 713, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The same binding values as above were obtained with protein-free liposomes of lipids extracted from microsomes, mitochondrial and red cell membranes and of pure egg lecithin.

{"title": "The interaction of phospholipid membranes and detergents with glutamate dehydrogenase.", "abstract": "1. Both the anionic detergent sodium dodecylsulphate and the cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide quenched the protein fluorescence of glutamate dehydrogenase. The anionic compound was more effective and brought about 50% quenching at a detergent concentration of 0.4 mM. The zwitterionic amphiphile, lysolecithin, did not quench the protein fluorescence and neither did the short-chain detergent n-hexylsulphonate, which under the range of concentrations examined (less than 1 mM) does not form micelles. 2. The zwitterionic phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, did not quench the protein fluorescence but the anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin, induced a reversible quenching of the enzyme fluorescence. These observations confirm the specificity of the phospholipid-enzyme interactions as deduced from the kinetic studies of the preceding paper. The degree of quenching brought about by the phospholipids decreased with increasing ionic strength and increasing pH and could be substantially reduced by basic proteins. An electrostatic contribution to the interaction is inferred from these results. 3. The binding of the anionic phospholipids to the enzyme is manifested in a further enhancement of the fluorescence of a 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonate-enzyme complex. The presence of substrates and allosteric effectors affect the interaction of the lipids with the enzyme as indicated by the magnitude of this increase in fluorescence. The enhancement of fluorescence of NADH when bound to the enzyme was not affected by the binding of the lipids. 4. The complex formed between the enzyme and phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine can be solubilized in isooctane. The photolability of the aqueous protein when subjected to irradiation at 280 nm is suppressed in the isooctane-soluble complex. 5.

In cell homogenates, (Na+ + K+)-sensitive, ouabain-inhibitable ATPase comprised an insignificant fraction of the total ATPase activity. Additions of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and beta-glycerophosphate (substrates for nonspecific acid and alkaline phosphatases) and of tartrate (inhibitor of acid phosphatase) gave no indication of inhibition. This suggested that the assay was relatively specific for ATP hydrolysis. The activity was found to have a pH optimum of 8.7 and a Km for ATP of 0.6 mM. There was an absolute requirement for Mg2+, with other divalent cations substituting less efficiently. When the Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity of intact cells was compared with that in homogenized cells, no significant difference was observed. The activity in intact cells was linear with respect to incubation time up to at least l0 min. Trypan blue staining and lactate dehydrogenase assays revealed that greater than 92% of the PMNL remained intact and viable during the assay. No soluble ATPase was released from the cells under assay conditions. In following the distribution of gamma[32P]ATP and 32P2 counts became cell associated. Since the experimental evidence supports the observation that PMNL remain intact and viable and that ATP does not penetrate the cell under assay conditions, it is proposed that greater than 90% of the Mg2+-dependent ATPase of the human PMNL is associated with a plasma membrnae enzyme.

{"title": "Inhibition of canine gastric acid secretion by an H-1 receptor antagonist to histamine.", "abstract": "Histamine H-2 receptors are thought to mediate gastric acid secretory responses, whereas H-1 receptors supposedly regulate mucosal vascular responses to histamine. In an in vivo chambered canine stomach flap preparation, the H-1 receptor antagonist, tripelennamine, injected intraarterially (22.1 mumol/kg) into the stomach flap reduced histamine-stimulated (1.25 micron/kg/min intravenously) acid secretion by approximately two thirds with a secondary reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow. This antisecretory action does not appear to be due to nonspecific mucosal damage. The H-2 receptor antagonist, metiamide, injected intraarterially (2.5 mumol/kg) also inhibited gastric acid secretion by about two thirds as did intravenously injected metiamide (4.5 mumol/kg), whereas intravenously administered tripelennamine (40.8 mumol/kg) was ineffective as an acid secretory inhibitor. Intraarterial tripelennamine reduced the secretory actions of the H-2 agonist, 4-methylhistamine (2.2 micron/kg/min intravenously), while intravenous metiamide depressed the gastric mucosal dilator responses to the H-1 agonist, 2-methylhistamine (5 micron/kg/min intravenously).

{"title": "Action of intrinsic sialidase of rat brain synaptic membranes on membrane sialolipid and sialoprotein components in situ.", "abstract": "The sialo compounds in the synaptosomal membranes of young rat brain were specifically labeled in vivo by the intracranial injection of radioactive N-acetylmannosamine. More than 95% of the incorporated label was found in glycosidically bound sialic acid. Specific activities of sialic acid in the synaptic membrane gangliosides G71 (monosialo), GD1a (disialo), and GT1 (trisialo) were similar; labeling in GD1b (disialo) was consistently somewhat higher. The highest specific activity of rat brain sialidase was evenly distributed between \"small myelin fragment\" and synaptosomal membrane fractions, and ouabain-sensitive (Na+, K+)-ATPase also was concentrated in the latter fraction. The greatest amount of bound sialic acid was found in these subcellular fractions having the highest sialidase activity. A microsomal fraction was discovered to contain a small amount of bound sialic acid with a very high degree of radioactive labeling, but no sialidase. Release of sialic acid from the relatively intact membrane preparations by intrinsic membrane-bound sialidase occurred in two recognizable stages. There was a rapid initial release, complete within 30 min, of approximately equal amounts of lipid- and protein-bound sialic acid, corresponding to roughly half of the enzymatically releasable protein-boudn, and somewhat less than one-third of the lipid-bound, sialic acid. The remainder of the membrane sialidase-susceptible sialic acid was released in a second, slower stage. The intrinsic sialidase released 16 +/- 1% of the total sialoprotein and 31 +/- 1% of the total sialolipid sialic acid. Approximately the same amount of sialic acid is releasable from membrane sialolipid by the action of exogenous Vibrio sialidase; almost twice as much is releasable from sialoglycoprotein by this enzyme as compared with the intrinsic membrane sialidase. Each of the various membrane gangliosides appeared to be equally available to the action of the membrane sialidase. The results of this study indicate that both glycolipid- and glycoprotein-bound sialic acid in the synaptic membrane are releasable in situ by the action of the intrinsic synaptic membrane sialidase, and they suggest that this enzyme may act to modulate the physical properties of the membrane. In addition to influencing the rate of hydrolysis of endogenous membrane sialo compounds by intrinsic sialidase, pH had an effect on availability of protein-bound sialic acid. At acid pH, lipid- and protein-bound sialic acid were similarly available, but near neutral pH, gangliosides appeared to be attacked preferentially.", "pmid": "849935", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001921 D005732 D006017 D007700 D008854 D009419 D009439 D051381 D012795 D013347 D013570", "label_true": "positive/labeled", "label_L100": "positive/labeled"}

The activity of the low-molecular-weight enzyme is expressed as its ability to phosphorylate histone. The protein kinase activity of the pellet is increased between 3 and 17 hr after reserpine injection. Our evidence indicates that this increase is due to a translocation from cytosol to subcellular structures of a kinase that utilizes lysine-rich histone as phosphate acceptor.

In 48 h fasted rats, fat cell diameters were decreased to five-sixths of that of the controls and plasma insulin levels were decrease to less than half of the controls; however, after 48 h refeeding, these parameters were restored to normal.

In adipocytes of refed rats, insulin bindings was slightly increased as compared to the controls, accompanied by a slightly decreased 2-deoxyglucose uptake and completely restored glucose oxidation. Conclusions from these studies are that both disorders in coupling of insulin-receptor complexes to glucose transport systems and intracellular glucose metabolism play major roles in the insulin insensitivity of adipocytes from fasted rats, whereas, in adipocytes from refed rats, intracellular glucose metabolism, rather than glucose transport, is mainly involved in restoring insulin sensitivity.", "pmid": "849730", "mesh_set": "D000273 D000818 D003847 D005215 D005247 D005947 D007328 D008297 D051381 D011972", "score": 22.426954, "rank": 1513, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

They have a stomach to body weight capacity equal to that of sheep. But for all its complexity, the passage of ingesta is reasonably rapid. However, there are three major sites of digesta retention and microbial fermentation of the ingested material. The cranial stomach provides the first major site of fermentation with VFA levels comparable to those observed in the rumen (125-145 mM/liter). Quantities of lactic acid are also produced in the foregut where the pH may vary from 2 to 5.5.

Gently lysed E. coli tsnC 7004 cell extracts reduced CDP when supplemented with NADPH as efficiently as the parent strain E. coli B/1 despite the lack of thioredoxin, indicating the presence of another hydrogen transport system. This could be divided into two parts by heat treatment at 85degrees; one heat-stable fraction, which was active in the presence of dithiothreitol or glutathione, and one heat-labile fraction. Addition of yeast glutathione reductase [NAD(P)H:oxidized-glutathione oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.4.2] to the heated extracts restored full activity. The results demonstrate a novel hydrogen transport system in E. coli consisting of NADPH, glutathione, glutathione reductase, and a heat-stable enzyme called \"glutaredoxin\". Reduced glutathione at physiological concentrations functions as hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reduction only in the presence of glutaredoxin. Glutaredoxin was not reduced by E. coli thioredoxin reductase (NADPH:oxidized-thioredoxin oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.4.5) and showed no crossreaction with antibodies against thioredoxin. These results demonstrate the existence of two different electron transfer systems from NADPH to deoxyribonucleotides and provide a function for glutathione in DNA synthesis.", "pmid": "7783", "mesh_set": "D004229 D004926 D005978 D005980 D006859 D009154 D009249 D012262 D012264 D013879", "score": 14.005283, "rank": 5074, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The present analysis is concerned with 2,065 initially well whites, of whom 65 suffered clinical CHD during a 4 years of annual follow-up. The subjects differed markedly in their levels of habitual vocational physical activity, which is classified (1) by division into sedentary, moderate, and heavy activity groups, (2) by blue collar or white collar type of occupation, and (3) by calculated annual caloric expenditure for both vocational and non-vocational physical activities. Intake variables that were studied in relation to physical activity and the CHD incidence include age, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, relative body weight, ECG abnormality, and cigarette smoking. Socioeconomic status (SES) is assessed by levels of education and income and by a combined SES categorization based upon both. Estimated composite CHD risk scores are based upon Framingham equations. The CHD risk factors, singly, as well as in a derived composite risk score, are higher for men with heavy compared to sedentary or moderate habitual physical activity. However, this is a spurious association found to be induced by differences of SES. Thus, when physical activity and SES are studied in a concurrent analysis, a higher CHD risk is significantly associated with lower SES status but not with differences of vocational physical activity. The CHD incidence in this population is studied in relationship both to the risk factors and physical activity by multivariate analysis, using the multiple logistic risk model. The incidence of CHD is significantly associated with age, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and cigarette smoking. It is not found to be associated with the type of occupation (i.e., blue or white collar), the level of reported habitual vocational physical activity, or the calculated total vocational plus nonvocational caloric expenditure in physical activity.", "pmid": "270942", "mesh_set": "D000328 D002140 D003327 D004734 D006801 D008297 D008875 D009787 D009790 D005082 D010809 D011446 D012306 D012959", "score": 12.492075, "rank": 5617, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The antiestrogens were injected intraperitoneally 2 h prior to an intravenous injection of [3H]estradiol, and the animals were killed 2 h after the estradiol. CI-628 reduces radioactivity in whole homogenates and isolated cell nuclei of cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, preoptic area -septum and pituitary. Nafoxidine reduces uptake in cell nuclei of the hypothalamus, preoptic area-septum and pituitary. In this paradigm, MER-25 inhibited uptake only in the pituitary. In the analogous behavioral experiments, with antiestrogens injected 2 h prior to an intravenous injection of unesterified estradiol, CI-628 and nafoxidine totally inhibited lordosis responding. MER-25 shows no inhibition of behavior in this paradigm. However, when MER-25 is injected 12 h prior to the estradiol, it inhibits retention of [3H]estradiol at 2 h in brain and pituitary cell nuclei, and lordosis responding is also inhibited. Additionally, the antiestrogens can apparently displace previously bound [3H]estrdiol. When the antiestrogens are injected 2 h prior to an injection of [3H]estradiol, MER-25, CI-628 and nafoxidine all show greater inhibition of nuclear estradiol retention at 12 h after the [3H]estradiol injection than 2 h. Analogously, when CI-628 is injected 2 h after an intravenous injection of [3H]estradiol, it displaces most of the radioactivity present in hypothalamic-preoptic area nuclei at 12 h after the estradiol injection. These results indicate that antiestrogens can prevent or reverse the nuclear concentration of estradiol in brain cells and are consistent with a role of the cell nucleus in the induction of estrous behavior by estradiol.", "pmid": "856418", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001921 D002467 D002540 D004958 D004965 D004978 D005260 D007031 D009256 D009594 D010902 D011187 D011301 D051381 D012726 D013997", "label_true": "positive/labeled", "label_L100": "positive/labeled"}
{"title": "Mechanism of post dialysis hyperventilation in  patients with chronic renal insufficiency.", "abstract": "Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain postdialysis hypocapnia. Three were tested in this study: impairment of tissue oxygenation by dialysis (D)-induced alkalosis (Bohr effect), the D disequilibrium syndrome, and the loss of carbon dioxide  (CO2) in D fluid. In 17 patients pre-DPCO2 was significantly correlated with plasma bicarbonate concentration (HCO3) and no disproportionate reduction of PCO2 was discernible. In 10 patients using a bath acetate concentration of 38 mEq/1 PCO2 was unchanged after D (35.4 versus 35.9 mm Hg before D), and was low relative to HCO3 whic increased from 21.2 to 28.0 mEq/1. After a dialysis using an acetate concentration of 25 mEq/1 HCO3 remained constant (20.4 versus 21.1 mEq/1 pre-D), whereas PCO2 fell from 35.3 to 30.8 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). Consequently PCO2 was again low relative to HCO3. Removal of CO2 by D fluid was excluded as a cause for low blood PCO2: addition of gaseous CO2 to the bath had no influence on arterial blood gases. Since post-D hypocapnia was not prevented when HCO3 was kept constant, it was concluded that post-D alkalosis cannot be the main reason for post-D hyperventilation, and that other factors related to the process of D are responsible.", "pmid": "4252", "mesh_set": "D000085 D000328 D001639 D002245 D005260 D006801 D006863 D006985 D007676 D008297 D008875 D006435", "score": 13.520176, "rank": 5254, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In contrast, all the intact rats fed the same diet for only 75 days, developed hyperplastic nodules in the liver. Transferred to normal pellet for another 25 days, hepatomas developed in 100% of these animals. The amount of protein-bond 3'-Me-DAB was found to be much smaller in operated rats than in intact animals. The glutathione (GSH) level in PCS-operated rats was lower than in intact controsl. A single large dose of 3'-Me-DAB led to the increase of only about 30% in the concentration of GSH during the period of 24-48 h, compared to the increase of 50-100% in non-operated rats. No clear tendency to a gradual increase in the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was noted in PCS-operated rats during the period of 5 1/2 months of 3'-Me-DAB feeding. The increase in GT-ase activity never exceeded 30% above the level of GT-ase in the livers of PCS-operated rats fed basal diet without the carcinogen. This striking inhibibiton of GT-ase increase induced by 3'Me-DAB in PCS-operated rats contrasted with an increase of GI-ase activity by 5,000% found in livers of non-operated rats with hyperplastic nodules after 75 days of 3'-Me-DAB feeding and the increase by up to 10,000% in developed hepatomas. These effects and the inhibition of 3'Me-DAB-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, manifested by lack preneoplastic morphologic changes and the absecnce of hepatomas in rats after PCS, can best be explained by functional deficiency of the liver to metabolize the procarcinogen 3'-Me-DAB into an activated carcinogen.", "pmid": "27891", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001711 D006528 D005978 D006965 D008099 D008113 D008297 D008749 D009374 D011167 D051381 D005723 D004124", "score": 23.21582, "rank": 1343, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Circular dichroic studies.", "abstract": "During avian erythropoiesis, the blast cells of the bone marrow mature into polychromatic erythrocytes (late stages knwon as reticulocytes) and then into mature red blood cells. When chickens are made anemic, the proportion of immature cells in the anemic bone marrow increases dramatically. The level of the lysine-rich histones. H1 and H5, has been found to be constant in the blood and bone marrow of normal and anemic chickens. This implies that H5 replaces H1 quantitatively. Urea-aluminum-lactate starch gel electrophoresis of H5 from these sources show that the degree of phosphorylation of H5 is proportional to the number of immature cells. About 70% of the H5 from the most immature bone marrow is phosphorylated, while 50% of the H5 from anemic blood is phosphorylated and H5 in normal blood is almost completely devoid of phosphate. When immature cells of the anemia bone marrow are incubated in the presence of inorganic 32P and [3H]lysine and [3H]arginine, extensive 32P incorporation is found in the phospho species. A minimum of nine phosphorylated components have been demonstrated by starch gel electrophoresis. The incorporation of 3H is time dependent. After 1.5 h of labeling, 3H is found in H5 containing 0, 1, 2, and 3 phosphates. tthe combined data suggest that newly synthesized H5 becomes progressively phosphorylated and that at the terminal stage of development, the phosphorylated H5 is completely dephosphorylated.

A procedure for preparation of sonic submitochondrial particles competent for adenine nucleotide transport is described. ADP or ATP transport was assayed, in the presence of oligomycin, in a saline medium made of 0.125 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 4-morpholinopropane sulfonic acid buffer, pH 6.5. 2. Sonic particles transport ADP and ATP by an exchange diffusion process. Externally added ADP (or ATP) is exchanged with internal ADP and ATP with a stoichiometry of one to one. The V value for ADP transport 5 degrees C was between 2 and 3 nmol/min per mg protein. 3. The transport system in sonic particles is specific for ADP and ATP. It is strongly dependent on temperature. The activation energy between 0 and 9 degrees C is approx. 35 kcal/mol. The optimum pH is 6.5, 4, Like in intact mitochondria, externally added ADP is transported into sonic particles faster at a given concentration than externally added ATP. The V value for ADP transport is 1.5-2 times higher than the V value for ATP transport. 5. The transition from the energized to the deenergized state in sonic particles results in a decrease of the pH gradient across the membrane (internal pH less than external pH) and in a 2-4 fold increase in the Km value for ATP. This latter effect is opposite that found for transport of added ATP in intact mitochondria (Souverijn, J.H.M., Huisman, L.A., Rosing J. and Kemp, Jr., A. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 305, 185-198). Energization has no effect on the V value of ATP transport in sonic particles. 6. In contrast to intact mitochondria, inhibition of ADP transport in sonic particles by bongkrekic acid does not have any lag-time and does not depend on pH. The inhibition caused by bongkrekic acid is a mixed type inhibition with a Ki value of 1.2 micronM. Atractyloside and carboxyatractyloside do not inhibit ADP transport in sonic particles, unless the particles have been preloaded with these inhibitors during the sonication. 7. Palmityl-CoA added to sonic particles inhibits efficiently ADP transport. The mixed type inhibition found with palmityl-CoA has a Ki value of 1.6 micronM. 8. [3H]Bongkrekic acid binds to sonic particles readily and with high affinity. Bongkrekic acic binding to sonic particles does not depend on pH and it has a saturation plateau, corresponding approximately to 1.3 mol of site per mol of cytochrome a. The number of [3H]atracytloside binding sites is much lower (one-fifth of the bongkrekic acid). External carboxyatractyloside does not compete with [3H]bongkrekic acid for binding to sonic particles. However, when carboxyatractyloside is present inside the particles, it inhibits the binding of [3H]bongkrekic acid.", "pmid": "15594", "mesh_set": "D000227 D000818 D001278 D001665 D001865 D002259 D002417 D003065 D004492 D006863 D007700 D008931 D009206 D009711 D010169 D013010 D013696", "score": 24.251202, "rank": 1139, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

After bunitrolol (10 mg i.v.), there was a statistically significant decrease in left ventricular and aortic systolic pressures left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, aortic diastolic and mean pressures, pressure-rate product and compliance index (delta P/delta V).  Left ventricular dp/dt, left ventricular dp/dt over isovolumic pressure, systemic resistance and heart rate tended to decrease, stroke volume and left ventricular stroke work index tended to increase, without statistical significance. Cardiac index showed individual variations, the mean values for the group being unchanged. Correlation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular stroke work index showed a shift toward improved ventricular function curve in most cases, deterioration in no instance. Supine exercise was performed in ten patients. Angina occurred in nine patients; in five only before and in four before and after beta-blockade. Post-drug exercise heart rate, pressure-rate product and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were significantly lower, the latter also in the four patients who still presented exercise angina. It is concluded that certain beta-blockers can improve cardiac performance at rest and during exercise in patients with coronary artery disease.

Mass spectral data indicated that the majority of these products were either oxidation products or isomers. At pH 7.6, the apparent first-order rate constants exhibited marked dependency on buffer concentration.

This effect does not depend on intact preganglionic cholinergic fibers. The augmented enzyme activity results from enhanced enzyme synthesis since it can be abolished by cycloheximide and NGF has been shown to enhance the incorporation of [3H]leucine into DBH molecules. The responsiveness of the adrenal medulla to NGF is also supported by light and electron microscopic autoradiograms which show that intravenously injected 125I-NGF is accumulated with high selectivity in adrenal chromaffin as compared to adjacent adrenal cortical cells. In spite of the many similarities between the response of the adrenergic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells to NGF, there are also two distinct differences. (a) In newborn rats the ratio between the TH increase effected by a single and 10 subsequent daily injections of NGF is 1:2 in the adrenal medulla and 1:7 in the superior cervical ganglia. (b) If adrenal medullae are transferred to organ culture after intravenous injection of NGF, maximal TH response is initiated 60-90 min after NGF administration. In superior cervical ganglia only a half-maximal response is initiated at that time. After a stationary phase a second increase starts after about 6 h to reach the maximum after 12 h.

The effect of pH on the inhibitory activity of each of the phosphonates was considerable with effective concentrations of inhibitor decreasing two orders of magnitude, in some cases, as the pH was increased. At a given pH the potentially hexadentate ligands, ENTMP and HMTMP, were generally the most effective inhibitors. The results suggested that EHDP, at currently administered doses, provides only a moderate increase in the capacity of human urine to inhibit calcium oxalate crystal growth.", "pmid": "19137", "mesh_set": "D002118 D003460 D006863 D063065 D010070 D013329", "score": 16.353699, "rank": 3906, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Biotinylinsulins as potential tools for receptor studies.", "abstract": "The preparation of affinity columns that contain insulin attached to Sepharose in a targeted manner by way of biotin-avidin noncovalent bonds is described. Insulin was acylated selectively at the amino terminus of the B chain with the N-hydroxysuccinimido ester of biotin to form N(alpha,B1)-biotinylinsulin. The ability of this modified insulin to stimulate rat epididymal adipocytes was (mean +/- SD) 94 +/- 9.6% (P, 0.05) that of the control insulin. N(alpha,B1)-Biotinylinsulin displaced 4-hydroxyazobenzene-2'-carboxylic acid from avidin, demonstrating affinity for this protein. The formation of the N(alpha,B1)-biotinylinsulin-avidin complex was visualized by cellulose acetate electrophoresis at pH 4. N(alpha,B1)-Biotinylinsulin combined with avidin attached to Sepharose to form affinity columns in which the hormone was attached to the support by strong noncovalent bonds. The determination of the loading of avidin-Sepharose columns with biotinylinsulin was greatly facilitated by the attached biotin which provided a marker whose concentration could be assessed accurately by titration with avidin. Biotinylinsulin attached to avidin-Sepharose beads retained the ability to stimulate rat epididymal adipocytes. The activity of several samples of these beads was about 15% that of free biotinylinsulin, based on the amount of biotinylinsulin anchored to the support. The advantages of biotinylated hormones for the targeted attachment of hormones to solid supports are discussed.", "pmid": "268619", "mesh_set": "D000273 D001360 D001681 D001710 D002846 D007328 D011972 D013329", "score": 16.856518, "rank": 3649, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

When compared with the LS diet, the HS diet decreased the characteristic lipid accretion in the liver of obses rats from 126 mg (LS) to 81 mg (HS)/g wet weight; corresponding values for the lean rats were 39 mg and 56 mg/g wet weight of liver, respectively. The HS diet depressed lipid synthesis de novo by liver homogenates and decreased the delta9-desaturase activity of liver microsomes from obese and lean rats by about 50%. delta9-Desaturase activity in vitro was also depressed by the addition of linoleic acid to liver microsomes from both obese and lean rats fed ad libitum on a standard laboratory diet.

Elasticity Parameters in Various Ages Power-extension diagrams of longitudinal and transversal stripes of the Aorta thoracica were recorded by means of an elctro-mechanical measuring instrument. The samples were taken from 108 male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 9, 15 and 24 months. The following parameters describing age-dependent alterations were calculated from the hysteresis loops of three consecutive extension-relaxation cycles: 1. the maximum power 2. the area of the first hysteresis loop 3. the characteristic of the relaxation-part of the third cycle. The maximum power and partly the areas of the hysteresis loops increased with age. The curves obtained by longitudinal stripes were approximated to a linear function (y = a + bx) plus a power-function (y = cxd). Their constants were explained as indices to the plasticity of the aorta, the retraction-power of the elastic fibres, the degree of the spiralization of the collagen fibres and the amount and/or the stability of the collagen. The ageing changes of these parameters indicated an increase of plasticity, an increase in the retraction-power of the elastic fibres, a rise of the pitch of the collagen spiral and an increase in the amount and/or in the stability of collagen.

Acid phosphatase showed increased histochemical activity in the basal area of the seminiferous tubule up to 96 h of cryptorchidism, and at 192 h much of the activity was located in large lipidcontaining bodies within the remaining seminiferous epithelium. Total and free biochemical acid phosphatase decreased during cryptorchidism in parallel with cell loss; there were no significant changes in total cathepsin D activity but free enzyme activity was increased throughout the experimental period indicating increased lability of lysosomes in the Sertoli cell.

{"title": "Pre- and post-natal development of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride hydrolase activity in rat tissues.", "abstract": "The ontogenic development of lipoprotein lipase and liver triglyceride hydrolase was studied in the rat. The enzyme activity measured in extrahepatic tissues fulfilled the criteria of lipoprotein lipase from the onset of measurable activity, i.e. it was inhibited by protamine and 1 M NaCl and showed requirement for serum and heparin for optimal activity. In the liver, measurable amounts of triglyceride hydrolase, active at pH 8.6 were detected 6 days prior to birth. However, till the fourth postnatal day about 50% of this activity was inhibited by NaCl and its sensitivity towards protamine was also higher than that of the enzyme in adult liver. Three patterns of development of enzymic activity were observed in extrahepatic tissues. In the lung, the lipoprotein activity reached the adult values one day prior to birth, while in the kidney only 30% of adult activity were found at birth. A linear increase of enzyme activity was observed in the heart; only 25% of adult activity were detected at birth and 100% were reached only 20 days after birth. The increase in lipoprotein lipase activity in the heart was accompanied by morphological differentiation of cardiocytes and by a progressive development of the capillary bed, which might be related to the pattern of development of enzyme activity in this organ. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity in inguinal fat fell from values 15 times than adult values between the 4th and 40th postnatal days. The enzyme activity in epididymal fat increased steeply between day 10 and 40, at which time it exceeded the adult values very considerably. These findings indicate that the regulation of the development of lipoprotein lipase activity in extrahepatic tissues is governed by local factors, which can differ even in the same type of tissue, as exemplified by the difference between inguinal and epididymal fat.", "pmid": "857810", "mesh_set": "D000273 D000375 D000818 D001921 D003964 D005260 D007668 D008049 D008071 D008099 D008168 D008297 D009132 D009206 D051381", "label_true": "positive/labeled", "label_L100": "positive/labeled"}

Following intravenous drug administration, there was no difference between irradiated and control animals in the amount of drug excreted in the urine.

At 5 days postirradiation, there was no detectable difference between irradiated and control animals in the extent of drug absorption. The effects of radiation on the extent of absorption of orally administered drugs were most pronounced immediately following irradiation. Irradiation apparently does not affect the absorption of drugs that are normally well absorbed or poorly absorbed due to slow transport across the GI mucosa.

Responses desensitized during continuous application of the neurotransmitters, and responses to 5-HT and dopamine cross-desensitized: a desensitizing application of one neurotransmitter also desensitized the hybrd cell to the other neurotransmitter. 5-HT and acetylcholine did not cross-desensitize. The hybrid cell 5-HT response was not attenuated by D-LSD, and was blocked by 10(-5) M morphine, although not via binding to naloxone-sensitive opiate receptors. 5-HT or the prostaglandin PGF2alpha caused the release of acetylcholine at the synapses of hybrid cells with mouse myotubes. Application of 5-HT or PGF2alpha also facilitated the synaptic release elicited by hybrid cell action potentials. Following treatment with the antimitotic agent cytosine arabinoside, co-cultures of hybrid cells and mouse myotubes exhibited plentiful synaptic connections only if maintained in medium containing 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP). After X-irradiation, co-cultures were synaptically active even in the absence of dBcAMP.

In women with normal glucose tolerance the diurnal plasma glucose concentration was maintained within close limits (mean +/- S.D., 4.70 +/- 0.38 mmol/l) but in chemical and insulin-dependent diabetics there was a marked increase in both the mean diurnal glucose value and in the variability of the plasma glucose levels observed through the day (mean +/- S.D., 5.61 +/- 5.61 +/- 1.03 and 6.02 +/- 1.26 mmol/l respectively, P less than 0.01). No difference was observed between the peripheral insulin activity of the normal and chemical diabetic women, and the impaired glucose tolerance of the latter group was due to a deficient insulin response to goucose. The diurnal glucose variability, expressed as the standard deviation of the mean, was found to be inversely correlated with the residual C-peptide response in insulin-requiring diabetics. The mean diurnal plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration was slightly raised in chemical diabetic subjects compared to normal women (mean +/- S.D., 0.77 +/- 0.34 and 0.68 +/- 0.20 mmol/l respectively) but this difference was not significant. Insulin treatment produced a marked reduction in circulating FFA concentration, with a mean value in the insulin-dependent diabetic group of 0.45 +/- 0.11 mmol/l (P less than 0.001). Neonatal glucose assimilation during the first two hours of life correlated strongly with several functions of maternal carbohydrate tolerance. This was associated with higher plasma insulin concentrations at birth, and a marked tendency to hypoglycaemia in the infants of untreated chemical diabetic women. Impaired mobilization of triglyceride stores was also observed during the two hours after birth in the infants of diabetic women.

The pH dependence of the equilibrium constant for the association of 5'-deoxypyridoxal with the active site lysine residue was determined spectrophotometrically. These dissociation constants increase with increasing pH over the range pH 7.5-9 and are correlated with the values obtained from fast reactions kinetics (Gilmer, P. J., and Kirsch, J. F.

In addition to this specific reaction at an active site lysine residue, a second slower reaction at non-active site residues is observable at pH values greater than 8. The pH dependencies of the association and dissociation rate constants for this slow reaction were studied over the pH range 8 to 9 after blocking the active site by NaBH4 reduction of the pyridoxal adduct.

{"title": "Ion selective effects of salicylate on antral mucosa.", "abstract": "The effects of luminal salicylate, 5mM, were measured on rates of ion transport by isolated antral mucosa. At neutral luminal pH, salicylate increases Na and decreases Cl permeability. Salicylate does not alter net Na transport but decreases net Cl secretion. At luminal pH 4, the effects of salicylate can be arbitrarily divided into two phases. The intitial phase is associated with an increase in Na and marked decrease in Cl permeability. Subsequently, a greater increase in Na permeability and a marked increase in Cl permeability occurs. Active Na transport persists in the presence of salicylate at pH 4. Indirect evidence also suggests that Cl secretion persists under these conditions, buy at a reduced rate. The rate of luminal acid acid loss also increases in the presence of salicylate. A 4-fold increase in salicylate concentration or decrease in luminal pH from 4 to 3 did not appear to intensify the effects observed for 5 mM salicylate at pH 4. The increase in cation and decrease in anion permeability observed at pH 7 and initially at pH 4 are compatible with an influence of a negative charge of the salicylate anion. The subsequent changes observed in the presence of acid also are compatible with the concept that as the mucosa becomes overwhelmed with acid, a nonspecific increase in permeability occurs. However, the effect of salicylate on active Cl transport is largely independent of acid diffusing into the mucosa.", "pmid": "9328", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002463 D002712 D004305 D005753 D006863 D008564 D011706 D011817 D012459 D012964 D014022", "score": 19.782797, "rank": 2332, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Re-evaluation of the H+/site ratio of mitochondrial electron transport with the oxygen pulse technique.", "abstract": "The number of protons ejected per pair of electrons passing each energy-conserving site in the electron transport chain (the H+/site ratio) has been investigated in rat liver mitochondria by means of the oxygen pulse technique introduced by Mitchell and Moyle (1967) (Biochem. J. 105, 1147-1162). The usual H+/site values of 2.0 observed by this method were found to be substantially underestimated as a result of the influx of phosphate into the mitochondria. This was shown by three different kinds of experiments. 1. Addition of N-ethylmaleimide or mersalyl, inhibitors of mitochondrial phosphate transport, increased the H+/site ratio from 2.0 to 3.0. The dependence of this effect on the concentration of either inhibitor was identical with that for inhibition of phosphate transport. Added phosphate diminished the H+/site ratio to values below 2.0 in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide. N-Ethylmaleimide protected the elevated H+/site ratio of 3.0 against the deleterious effect of added phosphate, but did not prevent a lowering effect of weak acid anions such as 3-hydroxybutyrate. 2. Prior washing of mitochondria to remove the endogenous phosphate that leaks out during the anaerobic preincubation led to H+/site ratios near 3.0, which were not increased by N-ethylmaleimide. Addition of low concentrations of phosphate to such phosphate-depleted mitochondria decreased the H+/site ratio to 2.0; addition of N-ethylmaleimide returned the ratio to 3.0. 3. Lowering the temperature to 5 degrees, which slows down phosphate transport, led to H+/site values of 3.0 even in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide. The H+/site ratio of 3.0 observed in the absence of phosphate movements was not dependent on any narrowly limited set of experimental conditions. It occurred with either Ca2+ or K+ (in the presence of valinomycin) as mobile permeant cation. It was independent of the concentration of succinate, oxygen, mitochondria, or rotenone, additions of Ca2+, Li+, or Na+ and was independent of medium pH between 6.5 and 7.5. Inhibitors of the transport of ions or acids other than phosphate did not affect the H+/site ratio. These results indicate that re-uptake of endogenous phosphate, lost from mitochondria during anaerobic preincubation, reduces the observed H+ ejection and leads to underestimated H+/site ratios of 2.0 in the oxygen pulse method. When phosphate movements are eliminated by the procedures described above, the observed H+/site ratio is about 3.0. This value appears to be closer to the true H+/site ratio for the primary H+ ejection process during electron transport.", "pmid": "9396", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002118 D004579 D005033 D006863 D006885 D007700 D008297 D008634 D008930 D010101 D010710 D011188 D011422 D051381 D013386 D013696", "score": 14.672189, "rank": 4777, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The blood pressure of the previously normotensive, virgin, SD rats and the SD breeder rats with preexistent mild hypertension became greatly elevated. ARH caused an increase in the preexisted severe hypertension in SHR virgin and breeder rats. Serum enzymes, e.g., CPK, SGOT and LDH, were greatly elevated concomitant with the finding of old and new foci of myocardial necrosis. ARH produced a dichotomous metabolic effect, i.e., elevated cholesterol, glucose, and corticosterone levels in SD rats but reduced levels in SHR rats. The zonae glomerulosae of the the regenerated adrenal glands of SD rats were devoid of lipid whereas the zonae glomerulosae of SHR rats were full of lipid. Intact SHR breeder rats develop arterial lesions confined to their reproductive organs but after ARH treatment, they were found to have aortic, coronary and renal arterial lesions which were similar to those which occur, spontaneously, in SD breeder rats.

The cholesteryl oleate was shown to be associated with vesicles (unilamellar liposomes) using Sepharose 4B chromatography. With this substrate, two different cholesteryl ester hydrolytic enzymes were demonstrated in subcellular fractions from the liver homogenates. In the lysosome-rich fraction an acid hydrolase was present, while in the cytosol fraction (150,000 g supernatant), hydrolytic activity was shown to occur with an optimum pH between 8 and 8.5. The substrate was characterized by Sepharose chromatography both before and after incubation with the liver fraction and was not dramatically altered even by rigorous incubation conditions. The lysosomal enzyme preparation was capable of hydrolyzing almost all the cholesteryl oleate in the vesicles. Hydrolysis of the phospholipid was proportionately much less than that of the cholesteryl oleate. Comparisons were performed between the vesicle preparation and an alternate substrate preparation involving the direct addition of cholesteryl oleate in acetone solution. The vesicles appeared to be a better substrate for the lysosomal enzyme whereas the activity in the cytosol fraction did not distinguish between the two substrate preparations.

Whole-cell suspension of the tumor cells exhibited full activity of the enzyme without detectable cell disruption under the conditions examined. Various amino acids, transported through specific membrane carriers, did not affect the accessibility of substrate for the enzyme. An inhibitor of sodium-dependent transport systems of amino acids caused no significant change in the rate of enzyme catalysis. Like glutathione or S-methylglutathione, S-acetyldextran (mol. wt 215000) derivative of glutathione, which is believed to be unable to penetrate into intact cells, caused marked inhibition of the rate of p-nitroaniline release from the synthetic substrate by the tumor cells. These data indicated that the active site of the enzyme faced to the outer surface of the cells. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase of the tumor cells was successfully affinity-labeled by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, a glutamine analog, without causing detectable change in the viability of the cells under the conditions examined. The rate of transport of alanine, leucine, glycine and glutamine into cells was not affected by the inactivation of this enzyme with the affinity label.

Evidence for direct involvement of the coupling factor in this \"adenylate kinase-like\" reaction.", "abstract": "Electrophoretically homogeneous coupling factor 1 from spinach chloroplasts binds ADP and converts the bound ADP to bound ATP and AMP. That this transphosphorylation of enzyme-bound ADP is catalyzed by the coupling factor itself, and not be a conventional adenylate kinase which might possibly contaminate preparations of the coupling factor, is supported by the following evidence. 1. The procedure for isolatio of the coupling factor is designed to separate this large (approximately 13 S) enzyme from the smaller (4.2 S) conventional adenylate kinase of spinach chloroplasts. The conventional adenylate kinase cannot be detected in purified preparations of the coupling factor by biochemical assay or by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 2. The activity of spinach adenylate kinase is completely dependent upon magnesium ions. However, the production of bound ATP and AMP from bound ADP by the coupling factor can be assayed in the total absence of added magnesium ions or even in the presence of added EDTA. 3. Comparative studies with inhibitors show that the coupling factor can produce bound ATP from ADP under conditions where the activity of adenylate kinase is strongly inhibited. Conversely, the coupling factor is prevented from synthesizing bound ATP from ADP under other conditions where the conventional adenylate kinase has high levels of activity. 4. AMP, when added in solution to the coupling factor, does not bind to this enzyme, even in the presence of APT. Thus, it is unlikely that the appearance of AMP bound to the coupling factor after its incubation with ADP is due to the production of free AMP by contaminating adenylate kinase. These results demonstrate that the isolated, homogeneous coupling factor from spinach chloroplasts has the intrinsic capacity to perform a phosphoryl group transfer between two bound ADP molecules and thus to synthesize ATP.

Step 3 is the hydride transfer. Under steady state conditions isomerization 2 is the rate-determining step in the direction of hydroxypyruvate-P reduction at higher pH values. At lower pH values, the hydride transfer step is also partially rate-determining.

At lower pH values the rate is determined by both isomerization 4 and the hydride transfer step.

Oxygen-sensitive electrodes were also inserted subcutaneously into 3 of the 8 fetuses. Periodic samples of maternal and fetal blood were analyzed for PO2, PCO2 and pH. Oxygen administration to the mothers reliably increased the PO2 of blood taken from the fetal carotid artery and less constantly augmented the PO2 of blood withdrawn from the femoral artery and vein. During 5-6 hours of study the oxygen tension of fetal blood samples of all animals progressively declined. However, the most marked declines in PO2 values at all fetal sites were regularly observed at those times as--or after--the mothers emerged from anaesthesia. At these times also the magnitudes of the increases in fetal blood PO2 brought about by administering oxygen to the mothers diminished markedly and in parallel at all sample sites. The closely similar magnitudes of these various reductions at all fetal sample sties indicate that the basic mechanisms leading to decreased oxygen delivery lie outside the fetuses and are most likely due to decreased maternal blood flow to the uterus because of increased maternal sympathetic stimulation.

{"title": "Pharmacology of the renal circulation.", "abstract": "The circulatory response of the kidney to drugs is conditioned by a variety of factors, such as basal vascular tone, dietary sodium and structural changes in the renal vasculature which accompany aging and disease. In addition, any drug which affects systemic arterial pressure will activate renal autoregulatory processes, which are superimposed upon the direct effects of the drug on the renal circulation. Renal autoregulation in addition to passive pressure effects probably accounts for the relative constancy of renal blood flow during the administration of renal vasodilators such as nitroprusside, diazoxide and minoxidil. Renal vasodilators which have minor effects on systemic arterial pressure, such as dopamine and glucagon, increase renal blood flow. These effects have been employed clinically in low cardiac output states. A variety of drugs affect the renal circulation by modifying the effects of endogenous vasoactive substances. The mechanisms of action include: receptor blockade; ex, adrenergic and Ag  II-mediated vasoconstriction: enhanced production by the administration of biochemical precursors; ex, arachidonic acid and I-dopa: inhibition of endogenous production; ex, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors: and inhibition of breakdown of endogenous substances; ex, converting enzyme inhibition. The effect of each of these interventions will depend in part upon the rate of endogenous production of the relevant vasoactive material.

Cortisone acetate (100 mg/kg body weight/day) was administered intraperitoneally for 1--3 days. Muscle wieght and protein content were significantly reduced by cortisone administration. Rates of protein breakdown were measured by tyrosine release from the isolated muscle into the intracellular pool and medium during a 2-h incubation with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. Rates of protein synthesis were assayed by [14C]tyrosine incorporation into protein of the isolated muscle during a 2-h incubation. Cortisone administration inhibited significantly the rate of protein synthesis after 1--3 days treatment and also reduced significantly the rate of protein breakdown per muscle after 3 days treatment. The synthesis of myofibrillar and soluble proteins was affected to the same extent.

After 6 weeks, the weights of tumors of mice fed the TYA-free linoleate diet were three to five times greater than those of mice fed the TYA-containing linoleate diet. Dietary TYA caused a reduction in the levels of arachidonate and an elevation in the levels of linoleate in mammary tumors and livers. Aspirin, another known inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, when added to the linoleate diet, did not affect the tumor size or the composition of fatty acids in the tumors and livers.

In isolated canine Purkinje fibers, phenolic 2 in a bath concentration of 20 mug/ml significantly reduced the rate of phase O depolarization, prolonged the repolarization time, and reduced automaticity. These in vitro and the above in vivo activities of phenolic 2 were similar to those observed for procainamide (1). Bioisosters, phenolic 2 and procainamide (1), have almost identical respective 13C NMR chemical shifts indicating that electron densities on the respective carbons are very similar. This may explain their similar antiarrhythmic and hypotensive effects. Phenolic 2 and procainamide (1) therapeutic ratios in ICR male mice (acute LD50/ED50 against chloroform hypoxia induced ventricular fibrillation) are 2.1 and 1.8, respectively. Procainamide analogues with electron-donating groups [OH, NH2, NHC(=O)CH3] on the aromatic ring possess more antiarrhythmic activity in mice than the analogue with an electron-withdrawing group (NO2).

Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured indirectly, from the distribution of the weak, non-metabolizable organic acid 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) between intra- and extra-cellular water. Respiration, aerobic and anaerobic and anaerobic glycolysis of the cells were studied at normal pHi (pH 7-0-7-4) or at low pHi (pH 6-2-6-6) and at 38 degrees C or 42 degrees C over 6 h in Warburg manometers; the ability of the cells to replicate in culture was examined after 3 h or 6 h incubation in the flasks. The relationship between pHi and extracellular pH (pHe) depended upon the buffer system used and the exact pH in question; no assumption regarding pHi based only on pHe measurement could be made. At 38 degrees C and low pHi, the Pasteur effect became negative due to a relatively greater inhibition of anaerobic than aerobic glycolysis. Respiration was unaffected and cell replicative ability unimpaired. At 42 degrees C and normal pHi, respiration was totally inhibited after 4 h and the Pasteur effect was decreased, in this case due to a compensatory increase in aerobic glycolysis without alteration in anaerobic CO2 production. Low pHi in the presence of hyperthermia enabled cell respiration to continue at a reduced level with no further change in glycolysis. There was delayed cell replication after 3 h at 42 degrees C and inability to multiply following 6 h hyperthermia: low pHi did not influence these results. It is concluded that with these cancer cells, pHi values maintained in the region of 1-0 pH unit below normal for 6 h had no deleterious effect on the cells.

The butyrophenones, haloperidol and spiroperidol, already at low concentrations (0.1 - 1 micronM) increased basal tritium efflux in a dose-dependent manner. The phenothiazines, chlorpromazine and fluphenazine, were much less effective in this respect. The butyrophenones strongly inhibited the electrically stimulated overflow of both 3H-DA and 14C-GABA, while the phenothiazines again had little effect. The action of 1 micronM haloperidol on 3H-DA release could be blocked by 10 micronM cocaine, but not with 1 micronM apomorphine. Apomorphine itself had no significant effect on 3H-DA release. Our data do not support the suggestion that presynaptic DA receptors on dopaminergic nerve terminals may modulate the release of newly taken-up 3H-DA. Some neuroleptics, particularly the butyrophenones may have presynaptic effects not related to interaction with DA receptors.

Three sequential periods of observation were obtained in both patients: on thiol (8.5 months); off thiol (8-9 months); on thiol again (7 months or longer). Other than nausea and vomiting at the maximum dose range, no apparent toxicity was observed. One subject died in uremia in the 24th month of the study. The half-cystine concentration in peripheral blood leukocytes decreased during both treatment periods in each patient from initial pretreatment levels in excess of 8 nmol-mg-1 protein (normal less than 0.1 nmol-mg-1) to 10-20% of initial values (Table 2 and Fig. 1, A and B). Reduction in total number of blood leukocytes or in the neutrophil fraction, where cystine storage occurs selectively in cystinosis, did not occur (Table 3) as a possible explanation for these findings; nor did storage of samples, a possible artifact, influence the cystine content of cystinotic cells (Fig. 2). Multiple site rectal mucosa biopsy clearly revealed cystine storage but serial biopsies did not reflect a positive DTT response when compared with the leukocyte assay (Table 4). High intersample variation in cystine content, even between samples taken at one time, prevented measurement of a treatment response. DTT had no apparent detrimental effect on the concentration of representative proteins, including hemoglobin (Table 3), serum insulin, and serum immunoglobulin during the treatment trials.

Intracerebroventricular (I.C.V.) injections of taurine into rabbits resting at an ambient temperature (Ta) of 10 degrees or 23 degrees C caused hypothermia but at 30 degrees C ambient temperature, rectal temperature was unchanged. 2. An I.C.V. bolus of 0=5 mg taurine immediately followed by a slow infusion of taurine (0-01--0-2 mg/min) into rabbits at 23 degrees C ambient temperature caused sedation and peripheral vasodilation and blocked the febrile response to Salmonella typhosa endotoxin (1 microng/kg i.v.). Sustained fevers, characteristic of fevers caused by central administration of pyrogens, developed after taurine infusions were stopped. Control infusions of taurine at the same rates in the same rabbits when they were afebrile had little effect on rectal temperature. 3. An I.C.V. injection of 0-5 mg taurine reduced the hyperthermia caused by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1; 2 microng) given I.C.V. A dose of 5-0 mg not only blocked PGE1 hyperthermia but also caused marked hypothermia. 4. Bilateral injections of taurine into the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic region, at sites where injections of Salmonella typhosa endotoxin caused long-lasting fevers, had no effect on rectal temperature. Similar injections into the reticular substance of the medulla oblongata, in the region believed to be concerned with a secondary temperature control function, were also without effect on body temperature. 5. Taurine (0-5 and 5-0 mg, I.C.V.) had no consistent effect on hyperthermia induced by amphetamine (2 mg/kg, I.V.) 6. We conclude that the hypothermic effect of taurine is not due to an action on the central neurone pool or pools concerned with the integrative control of thermoregulatory effectors. This amino acid appears to inhibit neuronal activity in efferent pathways which control peripheral vasomotor tone and heat production and to depress the level of arousal. Taurine delays the onset and extends the duration of endotoxin-induced fever, perhaps by two separate action: by inhibiting activity in central thermoregulatory pathways and by promoting accumulation of endogenous pyrogen in the brain.", "pmid": "857004", "mesh_set": "D000662 D000818 D001831 D004305 D004731 D007276 D008297 D011458 D011749 D011817 D013654 D013696", "score": 26.34515, "rank": 840, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

During postnatal ontogeny the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (T-OH), which is localized to adrenergic neurons, increased 50-fold in iris, and 34-fold in pineal nerve terminals of the rat. These increases paralleled the in vitro rise in iris [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) uptake, a measure of the presence of functional nerve terminal membrane. These biochemical indices of end organ innervation correlated well with developmental increases in density of innervation, adrenergic ground plexus ramification and nerve fiber fluorescence intensity as determined by fluorescence microscopy. Unilateral transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the SCG in 2-3-day-old rats prevented the normal development of end organ innervation: T-OH activity, [3H]NE uptake, innervation density, plexus ramification and fluorescence intensity failed to develop normally in irides innervated by decentralized ganglia.

{"title": "The actions of ouabain on intercellular coupling and conduction velocity in mammalian ventricular muscle.", "abstract": "1. The effects of ouabain on the electrical coupling between cells and the conduction velocity, theta, were studied in ventricular muscle preparations from calf and cow hearts using a silicon-oil-chamber. 2. After 90 min of exposure to 2 X 10(-6) M ouabain, an increase of the inside longitudinal resistance, Ri, from 420 omega cm to 1032 omega CM was observed. Assuming a constant myoplasmic resistivity this presumably reflects a reduced electrical coupling between myocardial cells. 3. Concomitantly, theta was decreased from 50-3 to 29-4 cm/sec. This change could be explained by the observed alterations in the maximal rate of rise of the action potential, (dV/dt)max, the amplitude of the action potential Vp, the membrane capacity Cf, and the sum, respectively, of the inside and outside longitudinal resistance per unit distance (ri + ro). Quantitatively, about 60% of the decrease of theta could be accounted for by the experimentally determined increase of Ri. 4. Time course studies revealed a biphasic action of ouabain on Ri. An early dose-dependent drop in Ri, equivalent to an improvement of the intercellular coupling, was followed by a delayed massive increase in Ri, whose onset and magnitude were also concentration-dependent. 5. The delayed increase in Ri was associated with an increase of the diastolic tension. Toxic ouabain doses (2 X 10(-6) M) produced irreversible changes on both parameters, whereas thereapeutic doses (less than 5 X 10(-7) M) affected neither of them. Reversible effects on both parameters were observed at an intermediate drug concentration (10(-6) M). 6. The strong correlation between decoupling and contracture is consistent with the idea that the intracellular Ca concentration, [Ca]i, is involved in the control of the nexal conductance. This is supported by the finding that increasing the extracellular Ca concentration, [Ca]o, accelerated the ouabain-induced decoupling, whereas reducing [Ca]o retarded it. 7. If anything, the contracture slightly preceded the increase in Ri. From this it is concluded that the threshold [Ca]i for the electrical decoupling between cells must be somewhat larger than the threshold level for the tension activation. 8. The delayed increase in Ri is compatible with an inhibition of the Na pump which according to the Na-lag hypothesis predicts an increase of [Ca]i secondary to a Na-accumulation. The early drop in Ri can either be explained by a stimulation of the Na pump, or by a non-monotonic relationship between Ri and [Ca]i.", "pmid": "839458", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000818 D002417 D004305 D004553 D006321 D006352 D066298 D008564 D009206 D010042 D013997", "score": 16.797508, "rank": 3680, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Transport into cells grown with acetate and deprived of ammonia is a saturable process, mediated by at least two systems operating maximally at different external urea concentrations. The lower concentration system, with an apparent Km for urea of 5.1 micron, was the object of detailed study. Transport of urea from a saturating concentration (57 micron) into ammonia- and acetate-grown cells freshly suspended in ammonia-limited medium was not detected. Upon further culturing in the absence of ammonia, derepression occurred with transport ability, first appearing at about 1 h , reaching a maximum at about 2 h, and maintaining this maximum at least 5 h. In contrast to this, CO2-grown cells became derepressed more slowly, and maximum transport ability was not maintained. Addition of ammonia or methylamine (5 mM) during nitrogen deprivation prevented further increases in transport ability and caused loss of previously acquired transport ability. Cycloheximide (10 microng/ml) had a similar effect. Energy uncouplers or dark, anaerobic conditions depressed transport. By these criteria, transport from low urea concentrations is mediated by a process that requires protein synthesis and activation by cellular energy, and the process has a rapid rate of turnover and of deactivation by ammonia.", "pmid": "856784", "mesh_set": "D000693 D001693 D002245 D002696 D003513 D003624 D007700 D008744 D009584 D000644 D014475 D014508", "score": 13.977759, "rank": 5084, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In the present study the importance of acid esterase activity in experimental xanthoma in hyperlipidemic rabbits was studied. Perithelial cells of small blood vessels were found to be poor in acid esterase activity and to contain bulky lipid masses. With time, increasing numbers of cells with high enzyme activity were found mainly at a distance from the vessels.

The rate at which CO displaces O2 from its combination with haemoglobin in solution, has been measured spectrophotometrically, using a rapid-mixing stopped-flow technique. 2. In the presence of CO2, the reaction proceeds by a unimolecular dissociation, with a rate constant r. 3. The relationship of the reciprocal of r to the ratio PO2/PCO is nonlinear, and a different curve is obtained at each CO concentration. 4. Measurements were made of the rate of the reaction when the pH was varied, with constant or varying PCO2. In both situations the value of r was found to have a miximum, for a given PO2/PCO ratio and CO cencentration, at pH 7.2. 5. An analysis of these results suggest that the Bohr effect, of pH and PCO2, is a dynamic equilibrium between four stable tertiary states of each of the alpha and beta chains.

{"title": "The relation between end-tidal CO2 and discharge patterns of sympathetic preganglionic neurons.", "abstract": "In 11 Nembutal-anesthetized, vagotomized, thoracotomized, paralyzed and artificially ventilated cats, the electrical activity of 32 single sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs), dissected from the cervical nerve was recorded at various end-tidal CO2 levels, together with the activity of the phrenic nerve. Seven of these neurons were insensitive to CO2 changes, within a range of end-tidal CO2 values from 1;0 to 10;0%. All 7 had a background firing pattern without respiratory modulation, even at the highest CO2 levels tested, i.e., had the same firing frequency in both phases of the phrenic nerve activity cycle. Seventeen units were silent at low CO2 levels, began to discharge at particular CO2 levels (on the average, at 2.3% CO2) and increased their firing frequency (on the average, by 0.9 spikes/sec/% CO2) as end-tidal CO2 was raised above the threshold level. Their background discharge pattern was characterized by firing only in the inspiratory phase of the phrenic nerve activity cycle. Three units had firing which was CO2-independent within a range of low CO2 concentrations and which increased as CO2 concentration was increased above this range. These units fired throughout the phrenic nerve activity cycle but had their peak frequency in inspiration. Five units had a firing frequency which was highest at low CO2 and which decreased with increasing CO2 levels. These units had their peak frequency in expiration. These results show that the output of this SPN population is strongly influenced by CO2 within the range of concentrations tested. The finding that sensitivity to CO2 changes is a property only of SPNs with respiratory-modulated firing pattern suggests that the CO2-dependent input is relayed to these SPNs via the respiratory center; A comparison of data obtained under hypocapnic conditions with data obtained in previous studies in normocapnic cats with mid-cervical spinal cord transections suggests that brain stem inspiratory neurons represent a major excitatory input to this SPN pool.", "pmid": "837231", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000818 D002245 D002415 D005725 D009474 D010791 D012119 D013564 D013997", "score": 17.781977, "rank": 3162, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Sarcomas have previously been reported to lack collagenase activity; a survival study using S37 cells was therefore undertaken in an attempt to distinguish between possible interpretations of the earlier data involving thymomas. A null result was obtained with either cysteine or EDTA, reinforcing the earlier interpretation that survival enhancement with thymoma-bearing mice was due to an effect on collagenase. Other sulfhydryl analogs were found to inhibit transport also, and the effect was more pronounced with system L than system A.

The cardiolipins and phosphatidylserine inhibited the enzyme. The inhibition by these lipids was found to diminish with time if the lipids were prepared and the reaction was studied in either phosphate or Tris buffers, but in zwitterionic buffers these lipid brought about a rapid, reversible inhibition which remained stable with time for at least 150 min. 3. The kinetic type of the inhibition was difficult to determine because of variation between lipid sonicates. Complex mixed types of inhibition were found with cardiolipin, and with phosphatidylserine the inhibition approximated to a non-competitive interaction with Ki(app) values varying between (0.9-6.1) x 10(-6)M. 4. The extent of inhibition decreased with increasing pH  and with increasing ionic strength. Basic proteins, such as cytochrome c, show a higher affinity for the anionic membranes and can dissociate the enzyme-lipid complexes. Cosonicates of the cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine inhibited the enzyme, the extent of inhibition increasing in proportion to the amount of acidic lipid. 5. Sodium dodecylsulphate causes a time-dependent inhibition of the enzyme. The kinetics of this effect and its variation with detergent concentration were studied. 6. The relationship of these observations to the structure and function of the enzyme is discussed.

In dogs with gastric and pancreatic fistulas, a liver extract meal at various pH levels was introduced into the stomach and kept at the preselected pH by intragastric titration. Gastric acid, pancreatic bicarbonate, serum gastrin, and plasma secretin were measured. The meal at pH 7 produced an increase of gastrin levels of 230% above basal and a gastric acid output from a basal of 0.8-16.9 meq/30 min. Acidification of the meal evoked a pH-dependent reduction of gastrin and gastric acid secretion, a pH-dependent elevation of pancreatic bicarbonate, and significant elevation of secretin at pH 3 (43% above basal) and at pH 2 (80% above basal). Postprandial endogenous acidification of a meal, without intragastric titration, also provoked significant release of secretin. Maximal pancreatic bicarbonate secretion in response to exogenous secretin was augmented 30% by the addition of a liver extract meal at pH7. It is concluded that in dogs with pancreatic fistulas, a meal exogenously or endogenously (postprandial) acidified is capable of the release of secretin in immunoassayable amounts.

There does not, therefore, seem to be a consistent correlation between changes in guanylate cyclase activity or concentrations of cyclic GMP and an increase in liver DNA synthesis. A modest rise in cyclic AMP concentrations was found, however, in livers of galactosamine-treated rats, which was coincident with the time of DNA synthesis.", "pmid": "18146", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004247 D005260 D005688 D006162 D006498 D008099 D008115 D009712 D051381 D013997", "score": 24.852547, "rank": 1040, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The kinetics of formation of horseradish peroxidase Compound I were studied by using peroxobenzoic acid and ten substituted peroxobenzoic acids as substrates. Kinetic data for the formation of Compound I with H2O2 and for the reaction of deuteroferrihaem with H2O2 and peroxobenzoic acids, to form a peroxidatically active intermediate, are included for comparison. 2. The observed second-order rate constants for the formation of Compound I with peroxobenzoic acids decrease with increasing pH, in the range pH 5-10, in contrast with pH-independence of the reaction with H2O2. The results imply that the formation of Compound I involves a reaction between the enzyme and un-ionized hydroperoxide molecules. 3. The maximal rate constants for Compound I formation with unhindered peroxobenzoic acids exceed that for H2O2. Peroxobenzoic acids with bulky ortho substituents show marked adverse steric effects. The pattern of substituent effects does not agree with expectations for an electrophilic oxidation of the enzyme by peroxoacid molecules in aqueous solution, but is in agreement with that expected for a reaction involving nucleophilic attack by peroxo anions. 4. Possible reaction mechanisms are considered by which the apparent conflict between the pH-effect and substituent-effect data may be resolved. A model in which it is postulated that a negatively charged 'electrostatic gate' controls access of substrate to the active site and may also activate substrate within the active site, provides the most satisfactory explanation for both the present results and data from the literature.", "pmid": "9067", "mesh_set": "D001565 D003903 D006427 D006735 D006861 D006863 D007700 D008956 D009579 D010084 D010544 D010545", "score": 23.001516, "rank": 1389, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Viruses which remained in the liquid phase after lowering the pH of glycine eluate were concentrated by adsorption to and elution from membrane filters. The method of choice included high pH glycine elution and subsequent low pH concentration; it yielded an efficiency of recovery from activated sludge of 80% for poliovirus type 1, 68% for echovirus type 7, and 75% for coxsackievirus B3.

Evidence for involvement of the paramagnetic nitrosyl-heme complex in enzyme activation.", "abstract": "Purification of soluble guanylate cyclase activity from rat liver resulted in loss of enzyme responsiveness to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), nitroprusside, nitrite, and NO. Responses were restored by addition of heat-treated hepatic supernatant fraction, implying a requirement for heat-stable soluble factor(s) in the optimal expression of the actions of the activators. Addition of free hematin, hemoglobin, methemoglobin, active or heat-inactivated catalase partially restores responsiveness of purified guanylate cyclase to MNNG, NO, nitrite, and nitroprusside. These responses were markedly potentiated by the presence of an appropriate concentration of reducing agent (dithiothreitol, ascorbate, cysteine, or glutathione), which maintains heme iron in the ferro form and favors formation of paramagnetic nitrosyl . heme complexes from the activators. High concentrations of heme or reducing agents were inhibitory, and heme was not required for the expression of the stimulatory effects of Mn2+ or Mg2+ on purified guanylate cyclase. Preformed nitrosyl hemoglobin (10 micron) increased activity of the purified enzyme 10- to 20-fold over basal with Mn2+ as the metal cofactor and 90- to 100-fold with Mg2+. Purified guanylate cyclase was more sensitive to preformed NO-hemoglobin (minimally effective concentration, 0.1 micron) than to MNNG (1 micron), nitroprusside (50 micron), or nitrite (1 mM). A reducing agent was not required for optimal stimulation of guanylate cyclase by NO-hemoglobin. Maximal NO-hemoglobin-responsive guanylate cyclase was not further increased by subsequent addition of NO, MNNG, nitrite, or nitroprusside. Activation by each agent resulted in analogous alterations in the Mn2+ and Mg2+ requirements of enzyme activity, and responses were inhibited by the thiol-blocking agents N-ethylmaleimide, arsenite, or iodoacetamide. The results suggest that NO-hemoglobin, MNNG, NO, nitrite, and nitroprusside activate guanylate cyclase through similar mechanisms. The stimulatory effects of preformed NO-hemoglobin combined with the clear requirements for heme plus a reducing agent in the optimal expression of the actions of MNNG, NO, and related agents are consistent with a role for the paramagnetic nitrosyl . heme complex in the activation of guanylate cyclase.", "pmid": "30778", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004229 D004578 D004789 D005292 D006162 D006418 D007700 D008099 D008297 D008769 D009569 D009573 D009599 D051381", "score": 24.843311, "rank": 1042, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In the bulbar reticular formation, most neurones were excited by 5-hydroxytryptamine; forty-three of fifty-one neurones excited by 5-hydroxytryptamine were also excited by stimulation in nucleus raphe magnus, nucleus raphe pallidus or nucleus raphe obscurus. Most of these stimulation-induced excitations were of long latency: LSD reduced six of seven of these excitations tested, while 5-hydroxytryptamine excitations were blocked on all seven. 3. In contrast, stimulation of areas adjacent to the raphe nuclei excited only fifteen of forty-six neurones excited by 5-hydroxytryptamine. Most of these stimulation effects were of short latency and none of the three tested were reduced by LSD, although 5-hydroxytryptamine excitations were blocked. 4. The relationship of the long-latency excitatory effects of stimulation with the position of the stimulating electrode in the raphe nuclei indicates that these effects are probably mediated via the raphe neurones and this is supported by the correlation of the effects of raphe stimulation with the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine applied iontophoretically and by the ability of LSD to block both effects. 5.

The effects of short-term and long-term administration of cyclohexidine on rat liver mitochondrial protein synthesis have been examined and were found to be different. 2. Long-term administration of cycloheximide resulted in inhibition of total cellular protein synthesis including that of mitochondria while, at short-term intervals, 8-10% of mitochondrial protein synthesis was cycloheximide-resistant. 3. The inhibitory effect was also reflected in terms of protein synthesizing ability of mitochondria in vitro, the inhibition becoming apparent at 40 min and showing progressive increase with time. 4. The observed inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by cycloheximide was not due to either inhibition of energy metabolism or alteration of amino-acid pool. 5. Cycloheximide did not enter mitochondria or sonic preparation under conditions in vitro. On the other hand, after administration of [3H]cycloheximide, significant quantities of the label were found to be associated with mitochondria and mitoribosomes. 6.

The animals were killed by a microwave beam focused to the skull at various times after the infusion. In brain nuclei the concentrations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their enrichment in 13C were measured by mass fragmentography. The results showed that in the five brain areas studied, substantia nigra contained the highest GABA concentration, followed by globus pallidus, N. accumbens, deep cerebellar nuclei, N. caudatus and cerebellar cortex. The concentrations of glutamate and GABA were comparable in some nuclei (substantia nigra and globus pallidus), but not in others. The glutamate content was 3 to 6 times greater than GABA content in cerebellum (cortex and nuclei) N. accumbens and N. caudatus. The turnover rates of GABA in substantia nigra, globus pallidus, N. caudatus and N. accumbens were calculated by applying principles of steady-state kinetics to the changes with time in the 13C enrichment of glutamic acid and GABA. In substantia nigra, N. accumbens and N. caudatus, the percentage of 13C incorporation into glutamic acid and GABA reached its maximum 10 to 15 minutes after the infusion. In N. caudatus and N. accumbens, the percentage of 13C incorporation into GABA was higher than that in substantia nigra and globus pallidus. The turnover rates of GABA were very similar in N. caudatus, N. accumbens, substantia nigra and globus pallidus (385-562 nmol/mg of protein per hr), but the turnover times were much faster in N. caudatus and N. accumbens. It must be kept in mind that in N. caudatus and N. accumbens the glutamate pool was several-fold greater than that of GABA.

The system was used to demonstrate that mouthrinses of 0.2 per cent aqueous solutions of stannous fluoride reduced the pH drops markedly for at least seven hours. A reduction of the stannous fluoride concentration increased the pH drops and decreased the duration of the inhibiting effect. A commercial toothpaste containing stannous fluoride and stannous pyrophosphate had an effect similar to the 0.2 per cent mouthrinse. It was shown that tin accumulated in dental plaque after application of solutions containing stannous fluoride. About 40 per cent of the amount of tin present in the plaque immediately after the mouthrinse was still retained seven hours later. It is suggested that the reduction in acid formation may be caused by stannous ions adsorbing to the bacterial cell wall thus disturbing membrane transport mechanisms, or through inhibition of enzyme systems essential in the fermentation of sugars.

{"title": "Properties of glutathione release observed during reduction of organic hydroperoxide, demethylation of aminopyrine and oxidation of some substances in perfused rat liver, and their implications for the physiological function of catalase.", "abstract": "The enhanced reduction of t-butyl hydroperoxide by glutathione peroxidase is accompanied by a decrease in the cellular concentration of both glutathione and NADPH in isolated liver cells, resulting in the release of GSSG (oxidized glutathione) from the perfused rat liver. This phenomenon, first reported by H. Sies, C. Gerstenecker, H. Menzel & L. Floh\u00e9 (1972) (FEBS Lett. 27, 171-175), can be observed under a variety of conditions, not only with the acceleration of the glutathione peroxidase reaction by organic peroxides, but also during the oxidation of glycollate and benzylamine, during demethylation of aminopyrine in the liver of the phenobarbital-pretreated rat and during oxidation of uric acid in the liver of the starved rat pretreated with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The rate of release of GSSG is altered markedly by changes in the metabolic conditions which affect the rate of hepatic NADPH generation. Thus, regardless of whether achieved by enhanced oxidation of glutathione by glutathione peroxidase or by oxidation of NADPH through other metabolic pathways, an increase in the cellular concentration of GSSG appears to facilitate its release. It has been found that, in addition to the hexose monophosphate shunt, the mitochondrial NADH-NADP+ transhydrogenase reaction plays an important role in supplying reducing equivalents to the glutathione peroxidase reaction and in maintaining the cellular oxidation-reduction state of the nicotinamide nucleotides. Spectrophotometric analysis of the steady-state concentration of the catalase-H2O2 intermediate with simultaneous measurement of the rate of release of GSSG leads to the conclusion that intracellular compartmentation of catalase in the peroxisomes and glutathione peroxidase in the cytosol and mitochondria distinguishes the reactivities of these enzymes one from the other, and facilitates their effective cooperation in hydroperoxide metabolism in the liver.", "pmid": "17386", "mesh_set": "D000632 D000818 D001596 D002374 D002469 D005978 D005979 D006016 D008099 D008297 D008930 D009249 D009711 D010084 D010477 D010545 D010634 D051381 D014230 D014527", "score": 21.988613, "rank": 1617, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Evidence for a renal alpha-adrenergic receptor inhibiting renin release.", "abstract": "The mechanism by which clonidine suppresses renin release was investigated in conscious rats. This suppression was studied by means of selected autonomic interventions in conjunction with changes in sodium balance. Serum renin activity and direct arterial pressure were monitored. Clonidine administration suppressed basal (by 68-85%), diuretic-induced (by 89%), and sympathetic nervous system-mediated (by 75-100%) renin release. Cholinergic, ganglionic, and peripheral sympathetic neuronal blockade did not prevent this inhibitory effect of clonidine. These results indicate a peripheral site of action for suppression of renin release by clonidine. The alpha-adrenergic blocking drug phentolamine prevented clonidine suppression of renin release in sodium-depleted rats and was partially effective in normal rats. Phentolamine blocked the decrease in renin caused by clonidine in ganglion-blocked rats. Clozapine, a new neuroleptic agent with alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, or phenoxybenzamine blocked the effect of clonidine on renin release in both sodium-depleted and normal rats. After ganglionic blockade in sodium-depleted rats, clonidine caused a significantly greater suppression of renin release than did an equipressor dose of methoxamine.

The stoicheiometries and affinities of ligand binding to isocitrate dehydrogenase were studied at pH 7.0, mainly by measuring changes in NADPH and protein fluorescence. 2. The affinity of the enzyme for NADPH is about 100-fold greater than it is for NADP+ in various buffer/salt solutions, and the affinities for both coenzymes are decreased by Mg2+, phosphate and increase in ionic strength. 3. The maximum binding capacity of the dimeric enzyme for NADPH, from coenzyme fluorescence and protein-fluorescence measurements, and also for NADP+, by ultrafiltration, is 2 mol/mol of enzyme. Protein-fluorescence titrations of the enzyme with NADP+ are apparently inconsistent with this conclusion, indicating that the increase in protein fluorescence caused by NADP+ binding is not proportional to fractional saturation of the binding sites. 4. Changes in protein fluorescence caused by changes in ionic strength and by the binding of substrates, Mg2+ or NADP+ (but not NADPH) are relatively slow, suggesting conformation changes. 5. In the presence of Mg2+, the enzyme binds isocitrate very strongly, and 2-oxoglutarate rather weakly. 6.

The activity of guanylate cyclase is altered to a much larger degree than adenylate cyclase, while cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterease activity remains unchanged. During the early phases of thrombin-and ADP-induced platelet aggregation a marked activation of the guanylate cyclase occurs whereas aggregation induced by arachidonic acid or epinephrine results in a rapid diminution of this activity. In all four cases, the adenylate cyclase activity is only slightly decreased when examined under identical conditions. Platelet aggregation induced by a wide variety of aggregating agents including collagen and platelet isoantibodies results in the \"release\" of only small amounts (1-3%) of guanylate cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and no adenylate cyclase. The guanylate cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities are associated almost entirely with the soluble cytoplasmic fraction of the platelet, while the adenylate cyclase if found exclusively in a membrane bound form. ADP and epinephrine moderately inhibit guanylate and adenylate cyclase in subcellular preparations, while arachidonic and other unsaturated fatty acids moderately stimulate (2-4-fold) the former. It is concluded that (1) the activity of platelet guanylate cyclase during aggregation depends on the nature and mode of action of the inducing agent, (2) the activity of the membrnae adenylate cyclase during aggregation is independent of the aggregating agent and is associated with a reduction of activity and (3) cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase remains unchanged during the process of platelet aggregation and release.

The activity of cat semicircular canal and otolith afferents was studied during yaw and roll rotations, respectively, to examine their dynamic behavior. 2. A sinusoidal analysis of the canal afferent activities showed that their dynamic characteristics are similar to those of second order vestibular neurons, except for a two to three-fold lower absolute gain. This agrees with earlier studies using angular acceleration steps. 3. Both divisions of the eighth nerve were sampled so as to examine afferents from both the utriculus and sacculus. Within the range of inputs used (+/- 25 degrees lateral tilt), the presumed sacular afferents (inferior division) showed either a gamma- or beta-response. However, the gain of their response was generally much less than for the afferents of the superior division (mostly utricular). This behavior is to be expected on the basis of receptor orientations and the components of gravity acting upon the macular receptors. 4. In response to ramp changes in angular position, some otolith units showed a phasic-tonic response pattern, i.e., an overshoot followed by an adaptation to a new steady state level of activity. The majority of units showed predominantly tonic responses proportional to displacement. 5. During sinusoidal rotations the predominantly tonic units showed small phase leads of 0 to 15 degrees at 0.025 Hz which remained constant or decreased to 0 to -15 degrees at 1.0 Hz. The gains were flat or increased by up to 2 fold. The phasic-tonic units showed greater phase leads, 10 to 50 degrees, and gains which increased from 2 to 8 fold. 6.

A natriuretic and kaliuretic response was induced by the intraventricular injection of norephrine (NE) or carbachol, whereas dopamine (DA) had no effect. The beta-receptor stimulator isoproterenol (ISO) induced an antinatriuretic and antikaliuretic effect. Intraventricular injection of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine abolished the natriuretic response to NE and carbachol and to intraventricular hypertonic saline (HS). By contrast, the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol induced a natriuresis and kaliuresis when injected alone and an additive effect when its injection was followed by NE or HS. Propranolol potentiated the natriuretic response to carbachol. Cholinergic blockade with atropine diminished the response to NE and blocked the natriuretic response to HS.

During the first examination of the acid-base state of the blood was almost at a standard level. An increased level of urea in blood plasma and a higher GOT transaminase activity testified to an excessive load on the liver. Urine pH was considerably deviated towards the acidic side and inorganic phosphorus was present in urine in a greater concentration. The pH of rumen liquor was slightly shifted towards alkalinity owing to the release of NH3 from urea in the food ration. The diagnosis--suspect chronical metabolic acidosis--was determined on the basis of the first examination. Chronical metabolic acidosis was definitely proved by the second examination when urea had been excluded from the feed ration. Repeated examinations revealed chronical metabolic acidosis which had originally been accompanied by a higher rumen liquor pH. On the basis of case histories and mechanisms of chronical acidosis, measures were proposed, resulting in an increase of the butterfat content of milk. Chronical metabolic disorders often follow a long-lasting latent pattern, manifesting themselves as a reduced milk yield and lower resistance; the clinical form of disease appears only at a later stage. The system of preventive diagnostics provides information on the changes in the composition of internal medium and of the faeces before a drop occurs in milk and fat production.

Fresh urine samples contained succinylacetoacetate (3,5-dioxooctanedioic acid) as well as succinylacetone. The inhibition of porphobilinogen synthase explains the high excretion of 5-aminolevulinate observed in hereditary tyrosinemia. Succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate presumably originate from maleylacetoacetate or fumarylacetoacetate, or both, and their accumulation indicates a block at the fumarylacetoacetase (EC 3.7.1.2) step in the degradation of tyrosine.

Chromatographic resolution and immunochemical differentiation from lipoprotein lipase.", "abstract": "Hormone-sensitive lipase and cholesterol ester hydrolase of chicken adipose tissue were markedly activated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (on the average, 235 to 275%; occasionally as much as 1000%). Diglyceride and monoglyceride hydrolases were also activated, but to a lesser extent (60 to 87%). The activation of all four hydrolases was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor and reversed by the addition of exogenous protein kinase. Following activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, all four hydrolases were deactivated in a Mg2+-dependent reaction and then reactivated to or near initial levels on incubation with cAMP and Mg2+-ATP. The reversible deactivation is assumed to reflect activity of one or more protein phosphatases. The maximum activation obtainable for the four hydrolases decreased when the tissue had been previously exposed to glucagon, indicating that the glucagon-induced activation was probably similar to or identical with the activation demonstrated in cell-free preparations. The pH optima for the four hydrolase activities were similar (7.13 to 7.38). Although the absolute activities and relative degrees of kinase activation differed according to the particular emulsified substrates used, the results do not rule out the possibility that all four hydrolase activities are referable to a single hormone-sensitive hydrolase. Hormone-sensitive acyl hydrolases were separated from lipoprotein lipase by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Lipoprotein lipase was active against triolein, diolein, and monoolein, but not cholesterol oleate. Incubation of lipoprotein lipase with exogenous protein kinase, cAMP, and Mg2+ATP had no effect on any of the three hydrolase activities. Lipoprotein lipase was further purified to homogeneity and used to prepare antiserum in rabbits. The immunoglobin G fraction from these antisera completely inhibited lipoprotein lipase eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns. However, the hormone-sensitive hydrolase activities (not retained on heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography) were not inhibited by anti-lipoprotein lipase immunoglobin G, and anti-lopoprotein lipase immunoglobin G did not affect the activation process in crude fractions. Thus, hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase, functionally distinct enzymes, have been physically resolved and immunochemically distinguished.

{"title": "Potential difference and the distribution of ions across the human red blood cell membrane; a study of the mechanism by which the fluorescent cation, diS-C3-(5) reports membrane potential.", "abstract": "1. The mechanism by which the fluorescent, cationic dye diS-C3-(5) responds to the membrane potential of red blood cells has been investigated. 2. The dye in aqueous solution absorbs most strongly at 650 nm. Addition of white, haemoglobin-free membranes red shifts the absorption maximum ca. 20 nm, while addition of membrane-free cell lysate results in the appearance of a new dye absorption peak at 590 nm. Thus the dye binds both to cell membranes and to cell contents. The component of the cytoplasm which binds the dye is non-dialysable, presumably haemoglobin. 3. Dye added to a suspension of intact cells shows a strong absorption at 590 nm indicating that the dye has bound to the cell contents and that the membrane is permeable to the dye. 4. The amount of dye which partitions into (and on to) the cells can be determined, as reported by Sims, Waggoner, Wang & Hoffman (1974), from the fluorescence of the dye remaining in the supernatant after the cells are centrifuged to the bottom of the suspension. In most conditions the proportion of the cell associated dye which is either free inside the cell or bound to the outside face of the membrane is negligible compared to the proportion bound to the cell contents. 5. On the assumption that the dye is not actively transported, the ratio of the equilibrium dye activities inside and outside the cell, ai/ao, is determined by the membrane potential according to the Nernst relation. Driving the membrane potenial negative then increases the cell associated dye by increasing the activity ratio and hence ai and the amount of dye bound to cell contents. 6. At the known Donnan equilibrium potential the internal dye activity can be calculated from the external activity. An empirical relation between cell associated dye and internal activity has been determined by measuring the dye partition between cells and medium at different external activities. 7. Using this empirial relation, and providing that any changes in cell composition do not affect the dye binding, the internal activity at any potential can be calculated from the measured amount of cell associated dye. The external activity can be estimated fluorimetrically. The membrane potential is then calculated from the activity ratio. 8. The membrane potenial of cells has been altered by adding valinomycin in the presence of different K gradients. Under the conditions used, the 'constant field' permeability for K-Val is 15-20 times that of Cl. 9. Dye binding to haemoglobin is influenced by pH and thus dye partitioning into cells changes with intracellular pH. Increasing intracellular pH increases the amount of dye partitioned, while decreasing pH decreases this amount. 10. When large potentials are produced with valinomycin there is no change in intracellular pH. This result indicates that in red blood cells intracellular pH is determined by the external pH and the Cl concentration ratio and not by the membrane potentials. 11.

F. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2860-2865). The enzyme was purified over 7,000-fold from liver cytosol with an overall yield of 8%. Enzyme activity was eluted finally in two distinct fractions by chromatography on activated thiol-Sepharose 4B. Both forms appear to be dimeric proteins having molecular weights of approximately 100,000 by equilibrium sedimentation and analysis on a calibrated Sephadex G-200 column. The apparent subunits are approximately 50,000 daltons as determined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Since electrophoresis in the presence of detergent is the only method used here to indicate subunits, the possibility that conditions of sample preparation resulted in splitting of a labile protein cannot be excluded from consideration. Ornithine decarboxylase has a very broad pH-activity curve with an optimum that shifts from pH 7.0 to pH 7.8 as the enzyme is purified. The apparent Km values for a highly purified mixture of the two forms of enzyme for L-ornithine and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were determined to be 0.13 mM and 0.25 micronM, respectively. Both sodium and potassium chloride were shown to inhibit enzymatic activity; 50% inhibition occurred at 270 mM for each when Km amounts or ornithine were used. Rat liver ornithine decarboxylase antiserum was prepared in rabbits using Form I of the enzyme as the antigen. The antibody was shown to precipitate quantitatively the ornithine decarboxylase activity isolated from induced rat liver and rat ventral prostate. The specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by rocket immunoelectrophoresis and by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate using immunoprecipitates obtained from enzyme preparations labeled either in vivo, with [3H]leucine, or in vitro, by reductive methylation using formaldehyde and sodium [3H]borohydride. The antibody preparation has been used in a titration method to assess the half-life of antigen in livers of rats induced for ornithine decarboxylase by injection of thioacetamide. In two experiments, the t1/2 of activity at the height of induction, following injection of cycloheximide, was 19 and 24 min, while the t1/2 of disappearance of antigen was 28 and 33 min, respectively. In each experiment the t1/2 for antigen was significantly longer than the t1/2 for loss of enzyme activity. Enzyme levels appear to be modulated primarily by synthesis and degradation of antigen. Furthermore, the observation that enzyme activity is lost with a shorter t1/2 than antigen is consistent with the idea that denaturation is an initial step in the degradation of this enzyme...", "pmid": "16005", "mesh_set": "D000367 D000818 D000917 D000941 D002262 D003429 D003513 D004790 D006207 D006863 D007700 D008099 D008297 D008970 D009955 D065108 D011467 D051381 D013853", "score": 30.701029, "rank": 450, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The distribution of 51Cr and 99mTc-labeled, viable and nonviable, unreduced or SnCl2-reduced autologous lymphocytes was determined 2 hr following intravenous injection. Viable 99mTc-labeled lymphocytes localized primarily in the liver, lungs, and kidneys or remained circulating in the blood. These compartments accounted for 34-54% of the injected radioactivity. One to three percent of the injected dose was recovered from the spleen, thyroid, bladder, and stomach, and all remaining organs accounted for less than 1%. Reduced, nonviable cells showed increased localization in the lungs and liver (48%) compared to viable unreduced cells (15%). Chromium-51-labeled lymphocytes were distributed primarily to the liver, lungs, and spleen or remained circulating in the blood. Hepatic localization differed from that observed with viable, unreduced 99mTc-labeled lymphocytes (32 vs. 12%), but vascular compartmentalization was similar (18 vs. 15%). The distribution of pertechnetate and reduced 99mTc was different from that of 99mTc-labeled cells. The urine and blood accounted for 84% of the recovered radioactivity, and for 43-45% of the injected dose, indicating that the patterns we observed with 99mTc-labeled lymphocytes truly represented cell-associated radioactivity. Similarly, the distribution of Na251CrO4 differed from that of 51Cr-labeled cells. The kidneys and urine accounted for 26% of the injected dose, compared with 5% for 51Cr-labeled lymphocytes, and only trace amounts of radioactivity were found in the lungs and spleen. The distribution of 99mTc-labeled cells, as determined by scintigraphy 90 min after injection, correlated well with data obtained by postmortem counting, suggesting that 99mTc may be applicable as a lymphocyte label for diagnostic gamma-imaging procedures.", "pmid": "833659", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002845 D002860 D005260 D008214 D011817 D011849 D011877 D013667", "score": 11.290066, "rank": 5909, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In the presence of heparin the ability of biogenic amines to induce the adhesion of thrombocytes decreased. Between concentration of the agents and the adhesive index of thrombocytes there exists a two-way logarithmic relationship. Intravenous administration of serotonin in a dose of 5 mg/kg and of epinephrine in an amount of 0.05 mg/kg to rabbits increased the adhesivity of thrombocytes, whereas intravenous introduction of 100 un/kg of heparin tended to greatly reduce it. On introduction of serotonin and epinephrine to rabbits against the background of heparin their ability to activate the thrombocytes adhesion diminished quite significantly. The logarithm of time lapsed from the instance of the heparin administration is linearly dependent on the  logarithms of values characterizing the adhesivity of thrombocytes.

The macromolecules binding corticosterone and its metabolites were characterized as (a) a steroid conjugate-binding (Stokes radius 2.5 nm and sedimentation coefficient 4.1 S in high ionic strength; pI 8.7, (b) transcortin and (c) a glucocorticoid \"receptor\". Competition experiments indicate that corticosterone and dexamethasone bind to the same site of the glucocorticoid receptor molecule. Different Stokes radii between the corticosterone-receptor and the dexamethasone-receptor complexes (6.9 and 6.3 nm, respectively, in high ionic strength) indicate that the two ligands induce different conformations of the receptor protein. This may be of importance when explaining the qualitative differences between the cellular effects of natural and synthetic glucocorticoids. 5alpha-Dihydrocorticosterone, on the other hand, competed to a very limited extent with dexamethasone for binding sites on the receptor. An assay of the inductive effect on liver tyrosine aminotransferase and tryptophan oxygenase indicated that 5alpha-dihydrocorticosterone was practically devoid of glucocorticoid activity.

Irrespective of the variable used, the results did not seem to be related to the degree of severity of the symptoms. Individual sensitivity of the oesophageal mucosa, the content of bilious components in the refluxed material, and the semi-quantitative character of the investigation may, in part, account for the results. Furthermore, the same investigation was carried out before and three months after a modified Belsey MK IV repair in 39 patients with hiatus hernia and symptoms indicating surgical treatment.

{"title": "Regional changes in [3H]-noradrenaline uptake, catecholamines and catecholamine synthetic and catabolic enzymes in rat brain following neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine treatment.", "abstract": "6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA) treatment of rats at birth (with the analyses conducted in the adult stage) produced marked regional variations in changes in endogenous noradrenaline (NA) and [3H]NA uptake in the CNS. The most pronounced reductions were seen in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and the spinal cord. Moderate changes or none at all were seen in the hypothalamus, septum and thalamus. Marked increases in endogenous NA and [3H]NA uptake were seen in the mesencephalon and the pons-medulla oblongata. There was in general a close correlation between the changes in endogenous NA and [3H]NA uptake. The results from the cerebellum varied, depending on the developmental stage at which the 6-OH-DA treatment was performed. 6-OH-DA treatment up to three days after birth generally led to a marked increase in both endogenous NA and [3H]NA uptake, while continuing the treatment caused a marked reduction of both parameters. The 6-OH-DA treatment caused no changes in endogenous dopamine (DA) in all regions analysed. Enzyme activity assays showed that DA-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were greatly reduced in the cerebral cortex, while the activity of both enzymes was almost double in the pons-medulla. No changes in the activity of phenylethanol-amine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), DOPA decarboxylase, COMT and MAO were seen after 6-OH-DA at birth. Measurements of choline acetyltransferase activity displayed only minute changes. The present results strongly support the view that 6-OH-DA treatment in the neonate stage produces a very selective action on NA neurones belonging to the locus coeruleus system from a structural standpoint, leaving DA- and PNMT-containing neurones unaffected. [3H]NA uptake in whole CNS was almost unchanged, despite the marked regional variations. The results have been interpreted as being due to a 'pruning effect', where the permanent NA denervation in distant nerve terminal projections (e.g. cerebral cortex) leads to a compensatory sprouting and increased outgrowth of NA terminal projections in areas close to the perikarya (e.g. pons-medulla).

Results showed that after cholestyramine administration serum levels, stool output and urinary output of tritiated digoxin varied over a wider range, but cholestyramine had no net short-term effect of any of these variables. After 1 month of cholestyramine administration, there was a small statistically significant increase in stool output of tritiated digoxin and metabolites.

Rate constants for transfer of the G(N-1) proton to H2O, OH-, phosphate, acetate, chloracetate, lactate, and cytosine (N-3) were obtained from 1H nuclear magnetic resonance line width measurements at 360 MHz and were used to estimate the pK or acidity of the exchange site in both the protonated and unprotonated nucleobase. These estimates reveal an increase in acidity of the G(N-1) site corresponding to 2 to 3 pK units as the G(N-7) site is protonated: At neutral pH the G(N-1) site of the protonated purine would be ionized (pK = 6.3). Determinations of phosphate, imidazole, and methylimidazole rate constants for transfer of the amino protons of cCMP provide a more approximate estimate of pK = 7 to 9 for the amino of the protonated pyrimidine. A comparison of the intrinsic amino acidity in the neutral and protonated cytosine is vitiated by the observation that OH- catalyzed exchange in the neutral base is not diffusion limited. This leads to the conclusion that protonation of the nucleobase effects a qualitative increase in the ability of the amino protons to form hydrogen bonds: from very poor in the neutral base to \"normal\" in the conjugate acid.", "pmid": "29660", "mesh_set": "D006152 D003568 D003597 D006860 D006863 D007700 D009682 D009712", "score": 17.28431, "rank": 3408, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Cytochrome c/ferri-ferrocyanide system.", "abstract": "The method of pulse radiolysis was used to generate reagents in situ in times (500 ns to 1.5 mus) short compared with the rates of the observed biochemical processes. This \"instant\" mixing technique is compared with rapid stopped flow measurements (limited in rates and concentrations) and T-jump measurements (limited to relaxation in the neighborhood of equilibrium) for the ferro-ferricytochrome c (C(II)-C(III))/ferro-ferricyanide (FCN(II)-FCN(III)) system. The reagents generated in situ were C(II) or FCN(III). Kinetically indistinguishable binding sites exist on C(II) and C(III) for hexacyanide anions. Reductive electron transfer to the protein proceeds within the FCN(II)-C(III) complex, with a rate of 400 s-1. The binding of FCN(II) on C(II) slows down the oxidation of C(II) by FCN(III). The sites of interaction on C(II) or C(III) with FCN(III) show effective charges of approximately +2. The association constant per binding site derived from the kinetics of electron transfer is greater than or equal to 10(4) M-1 for FCN(II)-C(II) and less than or equal to 10(4) M-1 for FCN(III)-C(III). Specific clusters of amino acids in the model of cytochrome C are suggested as binding sites. The oxidation-reduction reactions of FCN appear to involve electron equivalent transfer to and from such somewhat remote binding sites on the protein. Anions such as phosphate or sulphate also bind to these, less strongly than hexacyanides. In the presence of perchlorate the kinetics show the resolution of the pK=9.3 of C(III) into two parts: (a) optical changes at 695 nm due to ligand interchange on the heme-iron, unaffected by perchlorate and (b), a kinetic change leading to biphasic oxidation of C(II), with pK=7.4. This is attributed to the effect of perchlorate on water structure in the close environment of the binding sites. The high rate of oxidation of relaxed C(II) by FCN(III), (2 X 10(8) M-1 S-1 at mu=0) is not in agreement with an outer sphere Marcus mechanism.

In direction of acetoacetyl-CoA cleavage enzyme A shows a double competitive substrate inhibition when acetoacetyl-CoA is varied at different fixed CoA concentrations. With enzyme B a parallel kinetic pattern is obtained when acetoacetyl-CoA is varied at different fixed CoA concentrations. In direction of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis both enzymes show linear reciprocal plots of initial velocities against acetyl-CoA concentrations in absence of CoA. These initial velocity kinetics in the forward and in the reverse direction are in accordance with a ping-pong mechanism of reaction for both enzymes involving an acetyl-S-enzyme as intermediate. 3. Under saturating concentrations of substrate, the ratios of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis/aceto-acetyl-CoA cleavage is 0.31 for enzyme A and 0.08 for enzyme B. The maximum velocity in direction of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis of enzymes A and B are 0.43 mumol X min-1 X unit thiolase-1 and 0.10 mumol X min-1 X unit thiolase-1, respectively. 4. Both enzymes show nearly the same affinity for acetyl-CoA. The Km values are 91 muM (enzyme A) and 80 muM (enzyme B). 5.

It involves a single extraction step followed by gas chromatography with alkali flame ionization detection, and the results were linear in the concentration range 0.125 - 5.0 mug/ml plasma. The pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of heptabarbital and heptabarbital sodium were studied in a crossover design in 7 healthy volunteers after oral administration of 20 tablets containing 200 mg heptabarbital and hard gelatine capsules containing an equivalent amount of its sodium salt. Heptabarbital concentrations in plasma were determined at regular intervals. The absorption of heptabarbital from the tablets absorbed more rapidly and peak concentrations occurred between 1/3 and 2 h. In all cases the elimination of heptabarbital could be described by a single first-order process with an average half-life of 7.6 h (range 6.1 - 11.2 h). The half-life of the drug in each individual was about the same in the two trials. The relative bioavailability in each volunteer was estimated by comparing the areas under the plasma concentration curves. The sodium salt had an average bioavailability of 83% relative to the free acid. In some volunteers urinary excretion of unchanged heptabarbital was measured; cumulative excretion amounted to 0.16 - 0.30% of the administered dose. Four volunteers received one tablet each night for eight or ten days, but no accumulation was found. In three volunteers the half-life of the drug prior to and after these experiments did not change, whereas in the other volunteer the half-life decreased from 7.1 to 4.6 h.

Treatment of rats 35, 45, 55 and 75 days of age at surgery with TP (1 mg/260 g for 25 days) significantly increased the level of ABP in the testes of animals in all age groups except those hypophysectomized at 35 days of age. TP treatment did not significantly elevate epididymal levels of ABP above those found in untreated rats in any age group. In animals hypophysectomized at 100 days of age, acute treatment (3 days) with FSH (150 and 300 mug/day) significantly increases the ABP levels per testis and per epididymis. Similar treatment with 750 mug TP/day did not result in a statistically significant increase in testicular ABP. No synergism between the two hormones was noted under the conditions described. Significant restoration of testicular ABP levels per mg protein was achieved with 1 mg TP/day by 5 days of treatment. Treatment of hypophysectomized adult rats with FSH raised the epididymal/testicular ratio of ABP to about 40% of that found in intact rats while comparable treatment with TP (750 mug/day for 3 days or 1 mg/day for 10 days) only slightly affected the ratio. It is postulated that FSH may facilitate ABP transport to the epididymis in addition to affecting its production by the testis.", "pmid": "832763", "mesh_set": "D000375 D000818 D004822 D005640 D007016 D008297 D051381 D011944 D013737 D013739", "score": 25.62236, "rank": 938, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Non-suckling for 44 h decreased markedly uptake of all lipids by mammary gland and retarded clearance of chylomicrons from blood, while it increased significantly uptake of triacylglycerol fatty acids and cholesterol by adipose tissue. Non-suckling also decreased lipoprotein lipase activity in mammary gland from 7.7 to 0.4 units/g, while it increased activity in adipose tissue from 0.1 to 2.7 units/g. These findings indicate that lipoprotein lipase is involved in uptake of chylomicron triacyglycerol and cholesterol by mammary gland and adipose tissue, and also in uptake of chylomicron phosphatidylcholine by mammary gland.

It was confirmed that multiple non-Ag-B antigens provoke prompt first-set skin graft rejections, but are much weaker than Ag-B antigens in stimulating both graft-versus-host (GVH) and cytotoxic activity. No evidence of synergistic interaction was found between anti-Ag-B and anti-non-Ag-B responses either by GVH assay or in the generation of cytotoxic cells. Specific partitioning of cytotoxic cells on antigenic monolayers suggested that cytotoxic cells on antigenic monolayers suggested that cytotoxicity is predominantly directed against Ag-B antigens. The measurements of GVH activity consolidate previous work, which suggested that 4.5 to 12% of nonimmune T cells can respond to each Ag-B determined antigenic complex and eliminate the possibility that most of these cells were responding to non-Ag-B antigens.

The uptake of 3H-(+/-)metaraminol (MA) by tissue slices or pieces was studied in vitro in several peripheral rat organs of varying density of sympathetic innervation (the tissue level of endogenous noradrenaline ranging from 1.7-99.1 nmoles/g). In each individual tissue preparation amine uptake was corrected for entry into the 14C-D-sorbitol space. 2. When the tissues were incubated with 1.4 muM MA, the rate of total amine uptake (i.e., neuronal plus extraneuronal uptake of MA) remained virtually constant for up to 7 min. Therefore, rates of uptake were determined after 2 min of incubation with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.25-12.2 muM. In all tissues the total uptake of MA was saturable. 3. Under the condition of inhibition of neuronal uptake by the presence of 100 muM cocaine, the uptake of MA (considered as extraneuronal amine uptake) was no longer saturable. When tissues were exposed to 1.4 muM MA, the relative contribution by extraneuronal (measured in the presence of cocaine) to total amine uptake (measured in the absence of cocaine) was inversely correlated with the log endogenous noradrenaline content. 4. After correction of the rates of total MA uptake for the cocaine-resistant distribution of the amine, a saturable component of uptake was obtained for each tissue. This uptake was considered to be neuronal; it was subjected to kinetic analysis. 5. Apparent Km values for the neuronal uptake of MA were very similar in all tissues and did not show any dependence on the tissue level of endogenous noradrenaline (average Km = 1.2 muM). 6. V max values for the neuronal uptake of MA were linearly correlated with the endogenous noradrenaline content of the tissues (r = 0.976; P less than 0.001), the V max for the vas deferens being excluded. When related to the content of endogenous noradrenaline, the V max obtained in the vas deferens was lower than that for all other tissues. 7.

Important concomitant findings characterized by severe destructive lesions, massive calcification, granular ependymitis, and low grade inflammation were suggestive of late sequelae of an infectious process, possibly congenital. Transplacental transmission of an unidentified pathogen with teratogenic properties was hypothesized as the probable cause. The teratogenic insult started in an early embryonic period and affected primarily the development of the neopallium in the telencephalic wall. The arrested development of the neopallium disrupted the chain of interdependent developmental events; consequently characteristic morphological modifications normally induced by the continuous growth and differentiation of the neopallium failed to occur or took an abnormal course. The name architelencephalon (Greek: arche, beginning; telencephalon, cerebral hemispheres) proposed for this particular malformation of the forebrain indicates its resemblance both to the human brain at early stages of development and also to mammalian brains on a lower level of phylogeny. Associated anomalies included an unilateral microphthalmia with cataract, severe stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius and macrocephaly. The microphthalmia was either a developmental anomaly or was infectious in origin. The stenosis of the aqueduct was attributed to granular ependymitis.

Amacrine and ganglion cells in the carp retina were identified from such criteria as photoresponses, intracellular dye staining, responses to optic nerve stimulation and behaviour to a synapse blocking agent. 2. Responses of ganglion cells were accompanied by spike discharges., either facilitated or suppressed by photic stimulation. The cells were also invaded by antidromic impulses, which survived after chemical synapses had been blocked by application of atomized CoCl2 solution. In subsequent histology of the Procion-stained neurones, the cell bodies were found in the ganglion cell layer and the axons were often traced. 3. Amacrine cells were subdivided into two types. The first type gave rise to transient depolarizations at both on- and offsets of spot and annulus illuminations, usually being associated with spike discharges of which the amplitudes varied in different cells. In histology, the cell bodies of this type were situated in the inner nuclear layer and dendrites ramified in two or more discrete sublayers of the inner plexiform layer (the stratified amacrine cell of Cajal). 4. The second type of amacrine cells produced sustained responses during illumination, being associated with no spike but with small oscillatory wavelets. The cell bodies were situated in the inner nuclear layer and the dendrites ramified in a single sublayer of the inner plexiform layer (the monolayered amacrine cell). 5. An attempt was made to see the effect of activation of centrifugal fibres on amacrine cells, but almost all of about 200 cells examined did not respond to optic nerve stimulation.

This model permitted simultaneous evaluation of two segments of mucosa, one control and the other test, supplied by the same vascular pedicle. Imfusion of histamine (1.0 microgram/kg/min, intravenously) stimulated brisk acid secretion in both chambers. Topical application of 25 microgram dmPGE2 in 20 ml 0.3 M HC1 to the test chamber for 30 minutes prevented acid secretion from the test mucosa during a second histamine infusion. Since the control chamber showed no evidence of inhibition this indicates that dmPGE2 acted directly on the secretory cells, rather than after absorption from the bloodstream. This observation, however, does not exclude a possible local effect on mucosal blood flow. Direct exposure of the gastric mucosa to dmPGE2 increased the rate of back diffusion of H+ because of disruption of the permeability barrier, indicated by increased H+ back diffusion, Na+ efflux, and a reduction in potential difference.

As much as 40% of the total cytochrome P-450 was bound in the complexed form after a single administration of SKF 525-A. The addition of potassium ferricyanide (50 muM) to hepatic microsomes from SKF 525-A-treated rats destroyed the complex and made the total cytochrome P-450 available for carbon monoxide binding. At early times after administration of SKF 525-A, when the amount of complexed cytochrome P-450 was maximum, mixed-function oxidase activities (p-nitroanisole O-demethylase and norbenzphetamine 455-nm complex formation) were greatly inhibited. Later, as the amount of complexed cytochrome P-450 slowly decreased, these mixed-function oxidase activities gradually returned and reached control values in about 48 hr.

{"title": "Flash induced fluorescence kinetics in chloroplasts in the 20 microseconds-100 s time range in the presence of 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. Effects of hydroxylamine.", "abstract": "Flash induced variations of the fluorescence yield have been studied at 2 degrees C over a long time range (at 1 microseconds and from 20 microseconds to 3 min) in chloroplasts in the presence of 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) with or without addition of hydroxylamine. 1. In the presence of DCMU, a polyphasic rise is observed. A first fast rise (less than 1 microseconds) is ascribed to the transfer of the positive charge from the primary Photosystem II donor Chl to a secondary donor Y. Two hypotheses are proposed to interpret the existence of the subsequent slower increase (t1/2 approximately equal to 70 microseconds) which then follows the initial fast rise. 2. The effects or various hydroxylamine concentrations have been studied with a sufficient incubation time to inactivate the secondary donors Y and Z. This inactivation leads to a complete inhibition of the ability to emit oxygen. Under these conditions, the initial fast rise (less than 1 microseconds) is inhibited as shown by den Haan, G.A., Duysens, L. N. M. and Egberts, D. J. N. (1974) Biochim. Biophs. Acta 368, 409-421, and the oxidized Chl+ is reduced by an auxiliary donor D. The slow fluorescence rise observed after destruction of Y and Z has a similar kinetic behaviour to that observed in the presence of DCMU only and is polyphasic. In the presence of 10 mM hydroxylamine, the constant rate of the back reaction k1 between Chl+ and the primary acceptor Q- is estimated to be approx. (135 microseconds)-1 while the transfer of the positive charge from Chl+ to D has a rate constant k2 of approx. (105 microseconds)-1. 3. In the presence of hydroxylamine concentrations higher than 10 mM, there appears a rise in the 1-20 microseconds range ascribed to a direct reduction of oxidized Chl+ by hydroxylamine. 4. In chloroplasts treated with 10 mM hydroxylamine for 15 min and washed afterwards, the rate constant k3 of the back reaction between D+ and Q- is estimated to be approx. (100 ms)-1 which leads to a value of about 700 for the equilibrium constant between Chl and D. Hydroxylamine added under these conditions is able to reduce D+. The rate constant k4 of this reduction is estimated to be (350 ms)-1 in 0.1 mM hydroxylamine.", "pmid": "856263", "mesh_set": "D002734 D002736 D004237 D006898 D007700 D008027 D010785 D010788 D010944 D013050 D013997", "score": 19.17527, "rank": 2564, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

In the lung and liver of tocopherol-deficient rats, the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were increased substantially, suggesting an important role for both enzymes in protecting the organ against the deleterious effects of lipid peroxides. 2. Facilitation of the glutathione peroxidase reaction by infusing t-butyl hydroperoxide caused the oxidation of nicotinamide nucleotides and glutathione, resulting in a concomitant increase in the rate of release of oxidized glutathione into the perfusate. Thus the rate of production of lipid peroxide and H2O2 in the perfused organ could be compared by simultaneous measurement of the rate of glutathione release and the turnover number of the catalase reaction. 3. On hyperbaric oxygenation at 4 X 10(5)Pa, H2O2 production, estimated from the turnover of the catalase reaction, was increased slightly in the liver, and glutathione release was increased slightly, in both lung and liver. 4. Tocopherol deficiency caused a marked increase in lipid-peroxide formation as indicated by a corresponding increase in glutathione release under hyperbaric oxygenation, with a further enhancement when the tocopherol-deficient rats were also starved. 5. The study demonstrates that the primary response to hyperbaric oxygenation is an elevation of the rate of lipid peroxidation rather than of the rate of formation of H2O2 or superoxide.", "pmid": "12754", "mesh_set": "D000818 D005954 D005978 D005979 D005980 D006861 D006931 D066298 D050356 D008099 D008168 D008297 D009249 D010100 D010545 D051381 D014811", "score": 25.036283, "rank": 1018, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

While sodium nitroprusside increased guanylate cyclase activity in most of the preparations examined, the effects of sodium azide, hydroxylamine and nitroglycerin were tissue specific. Nitroglycerin and hydroxylamine were also less potent. Neither the protein activator factor nor catalase which is required for sodium azide effects altered the stimulatory effect of sodium nitroprusside. In the presence of sodium azide, sodium nitroprusside or hydroxylamine, magnesium ion was as effective as manganese ion as a sole cation cofactor for guanylate cyclase. With soluble guanylate cyclase from rat liver and bovine tracheal smooth muscle the concentrations of sodium nitroprusside that gave half-maximal stimulation with Mn2+ were 0.1 mM and 0.01 mM, respectively. Effective concentrations were slightly less with Mg2+ as a sole cation cofactor. The ability of these agents to increase cyclic GMP levels in intact tissues is probably due to their effects on guanylate cyclase activity. While the precise mechanism of guanylate cyclase activation by these agents is not known, activation may be due to the formation of nitric oxide or another reactive material since nitric oxide also increased guanylate cyclase activity.", "pmid": "14978", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001386 D002374 D002417 D002540 D004789 D005292 D006162 D006898 D007700 D008099 D008274 D008345 D009130 D009206 D009569 D005996 D009599 D009928 D051381 D012995", "score": 26.824951, "rank": 771, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Administration of PCA to receptive females initially terminated ongoing sexual behavior and this effect was correlated with the release of monoamines, particularly serotonin (5-HT). Sexual reflexes were abolished within 15 min of PCA injection. Other reflexes, including reciprocal forepaw treading, lateral head weaving, hindlimb abduction and Straub tail, were elicited by PCA. The long term infuence of PCA was the opposite. A facilitation of female sexual behavior occurred accompanied by a relatively specific depletion of 5-HT (10 mg/kg, 66% depletion; 20 mg/kg, 80% depletion) with both dopamine and norepinephrine depleted by less than 15%. This long term facilitation of female sexual reflexes was not blocked by dexamethazone suggesting that PCA was acting directly on the neural substrate for mating and did not produce it facilitation via adrenal progesterone.

In a previous study, a quinoline derivative (AMQ-j), exhibited a strong effect against Leishmania amazonensis and its antileishmanial activity was preliminarily associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study further explores the antileishmanial effect of this compound against L. amazonensis, as well as determines the main cellular processes involved in the death of the parasite. Moreover, this study evaluated the in vivo effect of the AMQ-j in BALB/c mice experimentally infected by L. amazonensis. The results showed that the compound AMQ-j induces a set of morphological and biochemical features that could correlate with both autophagy-related and apoptosis-like processes, indicating intense mitochondrial swelling, a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, an abnormal chromatin condensation, an externalization of phosphatidylserine, an accumulation of lipid bodies, a disorganization of cell cycle, a formation of autophagic vacuoles, and an increase of acidic compartments. Treatment with AMQ-j through an intralesional route was effective in reducing the parasite burden and size of the lesion. No significant increase in the serum levels of hepatic or renal damage toxicity markers was observed.

The responding under the fixed-ratio component was usually unaffected by low doses and decreased by doses greater than 3 mg/kg of meperidine.

Benzofuroxan (benzofurazan 1-oxide, benzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole N-oxide) was evaluated as a specific chromophoric oxidizing agent for thiol groups. 2. Aliphatic thiol groups both in low-molecular-weight molecules and in the enzymes papain (EC 3.4.22.2), ficin (EC 3.4.22.3) and bromelain (EC 3.4.22.4) readily reduce benzofuroxan to o-benzoquinone dixime; potential competing reactions of amino groups are negligibly slow. 3. The fate of the thiol depends on its structure: a mechanism is proposed in which the thiol and benzofuroxan form an adduct which, if steric factors permit, reacts with another molecule of thiol to form a disulphide; when the thiol is located in the active site of a thiol proteinase and steric factors preclude enzyme dinner formation, the adduct reacts instead with water or HO- to form a sulphenic acid; attack on the sulphur atom of the adduct by either a sulphur or oxygen nucleophile releases o-benzoquinone dioxine. 4. Benzofuroxan contains n o proton-binding sites with pKa values in the range 3-10 and probably none in the range 0-14; o-benzoquinone dioxine undergoes a one-proton ionization with pKa=6.75.5. o-benzoquinone dioxime absorbs strongly at wavelengths greater than 410nm, where absorption by benzofuroxan, proteins and simple thiol compounds is negligible; 416 nm is an isosbestic point (epsilon 416 = 5110 litre. mol-1-cm-1); epsilon430=3740+[1460/(1+[H+]/Ka)] where pKa=6.75. 6.

The present study analyzes the nature of this impairment. To determine if changes in exploratory activity accompanied the deficits in alternation, open field activity was measured daily from 2-22 days following bilateral E.C. lesions. Such lesions resulted in a pronounced transient increase in open field activity which peaked between 5 and 7 days postlesion, but subsequently decreased to near preoperative levels at approximately 11 days postlesion. Alternation performance was also analyzed, to determine which cues are utilized to make the alternation, and whether cue utilization is affected by bilateral E.C. lesions. Utilizing a plus (+) maze, animals readily learned to alternate goal arms, but even with extensive training, failed to learn to alternate turns (left and right). However, the ability to identify the two goal arms in a nonalternation situation (which does not require short term recall of the preceding trial) was not permanently impaired by bilateral E.C. lesions. Since bilateral E.C. lesions do not result in persistent deficits in the ability to identify the two goal arms, but do disrupt alternation performance, we hypothesize that the deficit in alternation might reflect an inability to recall which arm was chosen on preceding trials.

The pattern of labeling was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis followed by sequential analysis of single gels for carbohydrates (by staining with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent), for proteins (by staining with Coomassie blue), and for radioactivity (by counting gels sliced in 2-mm segments). The radioactive probe bound to membrane polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 94,200, 58,100, and 46,500 (Peaks A, B, and C, respectively). Peak A co-migrated with a small periodic acid-Schiff-positive band and protein Band 3 (nomenclature of Steck) (Steck, T.L. (1974)J. Cell Biol. 62: 1-19). Peak B migrated with protein Band(s) 4.5 slightly ahead of the major membrane glycoprotein (PAS-1). Peak C migrated like glycoprotein PAS-2 and protein Band 5, the actin-like, water-soluble membrane protein. In contrast to lactoperoxidase iodination and a number of other probes, [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid reacted minimally with the major membrane glycoprotein, glycophorin. When it was reacted with isolated ghosts, all molecular weight classes of polypeptides were labeled. Treatment of labeled cells with neuraminidase or trypsin altered the glycoprotein staining pattern, but not the radioactive peaks. On the other hand, Pronase eliminated the Mr=94,200 radioactive peak, diminished the other two radioactive peaks, and profoundly changed the glycoprotein and protein staining patterns. Treatment of the membranes of labeled cells in a low ionic strength alkaline medium did not alter radioactive peaks and demonstrated that Peak C differed from the actin-like membrane protein. A nonionic detergent, Triton X-100, solubilized all radioactive components. The studies have defined the binding of [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid to external proteins of the human red cell membrane. Its pattern of reaction differs quantitatively and qualitatively from other commonly used reagents, and it provides a useful additional vectorial probe for the study of membrane topography.

The accumulation of DNA, RNA, and protein in three brain regions occurred each in its own characteristic pattern although three distinct phases could be observed. The most rapid accumulation always occurred during embryonic development followed by a slower accumulation from hatching to 3-mo. with very little or no change in the brain macromolecule content thereafter. In all three brain regions, the cell-free protein synthetic activity increased during embryonic development, reaching maximum around hatching then decreased substantially (50-70%) after hatching. Comparison of 18-day-old embryonic and 1 1/2-year-old adult brain tissue showed that there was no significant alteration in the relative proportion of membrane-bound and free ribosomes. When the products of cell-free protein synthesis by embryonic and adult brain preparations were compared by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it was found that the percentage of various proteins synthesized by embryonic brain tissue was very similar to that of the adult. It is concluded that the decrease in cell-free protein synthesis is due to a general decrease in the synthesis of all types of proteins rather than a decrease in a specific group or groups of proteins.", "pmid": "846232", "mesh_set": "D000367 D000818 D001921 D001923 D002531 D002642 D002645 D004247 D009419 D012313 D012270 D003336", "score": 22.556297, "rank": 1486, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Conversely, high doses of androgen (greater than or equal to 3 mg) translocated the estrogen receptor (RE) and stimulated general protein synthesis. In addition, these high doses induced a specific uterine protein undistinguishable from that induced by estradiol treatment (IP).

Several products, which probably differed in the size of the oligosaccharide moiety, were labeled. These could be partially resolved by thin layer chromatography and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The labeled lipid-bound oligosaccharides were retained on DEAE-cellulose more strongly than synthetic dolichyl alpha-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate. They were stable to mild alkali, but labile to acid and hot alkali. Acid treatment yielded a neutral 14C-labeled oligosaccharide fraction which was estimated by gel filtration to have a minimum of 8 monosaccharide residues. Hot alkali treatment yielded a mixture of neutral and acidic 14C-labeled oligosaccharides which could be transformed into neutral products by alkaline phosphatase. The D-[14C]mannose residues were alpha-linked at the nonreducing terminus of the oligosaccharides since they could be removed completely with alpha-mannosidase. Most of the D-[14C]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides were retained on concanavalin A Sepharose and eluted with methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. Pancreatic dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate incubated with calf pancreas microsomes in the presence of sodium taurocholate was efficiently utilized as donor of alpha-D-mannosyl residues in lipid-bound oligosaccharides. The products formed from dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate were identical with those formed from GDP-D-[14C]mannose, and evidence was obtained to show that the dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate was serving as donor without prior conversion to GDP-D-[14C]mannose. Transfer of mannose from dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate to lipid-bound oligosaccharides took place at a pH optimum of 7.3, whereas transfer to the precipitate containing glycoproteins was greatest at pH 6.0 in Tris/maleate buffer. The addition of divalent cation was not required, but low concentrations of EDTA were extremely inhibitory. The carbohydrate composition of the lipid-bound oligosaccharides of microsomal membranes was investigated by gas-liquid chromatography and by reduction with sodium borotritide. A heterogeneous mixture of oligosaccharides containing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, D-mannose, and D-glucose varying in proportions from approximately 1/2.5/0.5 to 1/5/1.5 was obtained with glucosamine at the reducing end.

From the standpoint of monomer-dimer equilibrium of hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase [EC 1.4.3.3] and the interaction between the enzyme and small molecules, the effect of pH on the binding of p-aminobenzoate to the monomer and dimer of the enzyme was studied by kinetic methods and spectrophotometric titration. 2. The maximum binding number of p-aminobenzoate to the dimer is two molecules, and there is no interaction between the two active sites of the dimer (i.e., no cooperativity) over the range of pH from 6.5 to 10. 3. The affinity of the dimer for p-aminobenzoate is several times higher than that of the monomer at pH 6.5-10, and consequently p-aminobenzoate induces dimerization in the equilibrium state of D-amino acid oxidase. The interaction energy of two subunits of the dimer is stabilized by the binding of p-aminobenzoate by 1-2 kcal/mole over the pH range studied. 4. The binding sites of the quasi-substrate, p-aminobenzoate, in the dimer and the intersubunit binding site of the dimer are clearly different, because p-aminobenzoate induces dimerization of the enzyme. 5. The pK values of ionizing groups in the free monomer and the free dimer which participate in the binding of the competitive inhibitor, p-aminobenzoate, are approximately the same, 8.7, as determined from the pH dependence of the affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme. Furthermore, no pK for the enzyme-inhibitor complex in the pH range 6.5-10 was observed. 6.

An enzyme fraction similar to APS-sulfotransferases from plant sources was purified 228-fold from Rhodospirillum rubrum. It is suggested here that this enzyme is specific for adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, because the purified enzyme fraction metabolized adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate; 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, however, only at a rate of 1/10 of that with adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate. Further, the reaction with 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate was inhibited with 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate whereas this nucleotide had no effect on the reaction with adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate. For this activity with adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate the name APS-sulfotransferase is suggested. This APS-sulfotransferase needs thiols for activity; good rates were obtained with either dithioerythritol or reduced glutathione; other thiols like cysteine, 2'-3'-dimercaptopropanol or mercaptoethanol are less effective. The electron donor methylviologen did not catalyze this reaction.

{"title": "Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of Acetobacter xylinum. Purification and regulatory properties.", "abstract": "The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of Acetobacter xylinum was purified to homogeneity. It consists of three main polypeptide chains with a total molecular weight of about 2.4 X 10(6). It catalyzes the overall Mg2+ and thiamin pyrophosphate-dependent, NAD+- and CoA-linked oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate, as well as the partial reactions characteristic of the three enzyme components described for the complex from other sources. Initial velocity studies revealed marked positive cooperativity for the substrate alpha-ketoglutarate (Hill coefficient (nH) = 2.0; concentration of ligand at half-maximum effect (S0.5) = 8 mM). The sigmoidal [alpha-ketoglutarate]-velocity relationship became hyperbolic upon addition of AMP or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPyAD) or in the presence of high concentrations of NAD. S0.5 (alpha-ketoglutarate) decreased to 1 mM, but Vmax was unchanged. Saturation curves for NAD and AMP are sigmoidal (nH = 2) at low alpha-ketoglutarate concentrations and become hyperbolic at high alpha-ketoglutarate concentrations. As judged by S0.5, the relative efficiency of the allosteric effectors is AcPyAD greater than AMP greater than alpha-ketoglutarate- greater than NAD+. Half-maximal changes in nH, S0.5, and activation by AMP occur at a pH significantly different from that of half-maximal activity. A model for the allosteric behavior of the complex is proposed in which the first enzyme component of the complex (E1) is the site for the allosteric interactions and AMP is the primary positive modifier, whereas NAD and AcPyAD act as AMP analogues. The overall reaction is competitively inhibited by NADH with respect to NAD (K1 = 20 micronM) and by succinyl-CoA with respect of CoA (K1 = 3 micronM).

It had been shown earlier that citrate synthase from another osmoconformer (oyster) is also not sensitive to ionic strength while citrate synthase from osmoregulating white shrimp is sensitive to increasing levels of salt. However, these enzymes are characteristically regulated by ATP and alpha-ketoglutarate. Both forms of citrate synthase are denatured by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and are aided by salt levels in their refolding but the rate and extent of refolding of the osmoconformer citrate synthase are greater than those of the osmoregulator citrate synthase.

To explain the results, we suggest that auditory cortex is essential for an organized perception of space including the relation of the animal's position to other objects in space.

{"title": "Inversion of optical configuration of alpha-methylfluorene-2-acetic acid (cicloprofen) in rats and monkeys.", "abstract": "A simple and sensitive radiometric method to determine the individual enantiomers of cicloprofen has been developed. 14C-Cicloprofen was converted to its L-leucine diastereoisomers, which were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantified by measuring the radioactivity in the area corresponding to each individual diastereoisomer. This technique has also been used to measure the enantiomers of unlabeled cicloprofen by condensing with 14C-labeled L-leucine. By using the radiometric method, a unique biotransformation process, the inversion of the (-)-enantiomer of alpha-methylfluorene-2-acetic acid to its (+)-enantiomer, has been demonstrated in the rat and monkey. The rate of (-)- to (+)-inversion was found to be faster in the rat than in the monkey. After single or repeated oral adminstration of the racemic modification or the (-)-enantiomer of cicloprofen to both species, the ratio of (+)- to (-)-enantiomers of cicloprofen in plasma, urine, or bile increased with time. At 5, 22, and 48 hr after oral administration of a single 50-mg/kg dose of the (-)-enantiomer, 14C-cicloprofen in rat plasma contained 20, 50, and 79%, respectively, of the (+)-enantiomer. After receiving the same dose of (-)-enantiomer, monkey plasma contained 16.5% and 32% of (+)-enantiomer at 8 and 24 hr, respectively. After oral administration of a single 50-mg/kg dose of the (+)-enantiomer of 14C-cicloprofen to rats and monkeys, the percentage of (-)-enantiomer in plasma varied from 2 to 15%. Since the administered (+)-enantiomer contained 4% of (-)-enantiomer and the (+)-enantiomer was excreted at a faster rate than its (-)-antipode by rats or monkeys, it is not known whether an occasional small percentage increase of (-)-enantiomer in plasma resulted from the (+)-to-(-) inversion, or from faster elimination of the (+)-enantiomer.

Oxygen consumption and palmitoylcarnitine formation.", "abstract": "Rat heart and liver mitochondria, respectively, oxidized palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoylcarnitine optimally at 20-30 and 10-20 nmol substrate/mg. The oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA was accompanied by a lag in State 3 respiration that was proportional to the palmitoyl-CoA concentration. The delay in State 3 rates was more prolonged in liver than in heart at comparable palmitoyl-CoA levels. A similar range of palmitoyl-CoA concentrations produced significant inhibition of respiration in mitochondria oxidizing glutamate-malate. The inhibition was not due to a detergent effect of palmitoyl-CoA since addition of carnitine restored State 3 rates. Electron microscopic examination of mitochondria at low palmitoyl-CoA levels revealed normal ultrastructure. At comparable concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA, formation of palmitoylcarnitine by mitochondria from rat heart and liver followed first-order kinetics. The apparent first-order rate constants decreased with increasing palmitoyl-CoA. These results suggest that substrate inhibition may influence the rate of palmitoyl carnitine formation even at physiological concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA. The apparent first-order rate constant at palmitoyl-CoA levels (12 nmol palmitoyl CoA/mg) optimally oxidized by liver mitochondria, was one-third the value of the apparent rate constant measured in heart mitochondria at the identical substrate level. The prolongation in time to reach equilibrium may acocunt for the relatively greater respiratory sensitivity of liver mitochondria to increasing levels of palmitoyl-CoA.", "pmid": "836862", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002331 D003065 D007700 D008930 D008931 D009206 D010101 D010169 D051381", "score": 21.959991, "rank": 1622, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Using an increase in food consumption of 20% or more as the criterion of a positive response, the dose effective in 50% of the animals was 0.35 mg/kg p.o. for both CDC and cyproheptadine. Both CDC and cyproheptadine possess a long duration of appetite-stimulant action, exceeding 18 hr following 0.5 mg/kg p.o. The ancillary pharmacologic properties of CDC are considerably reduced over those of cyproheptadine, except for antihistaminic activity, CDC being about two times more potent (protection against lethality in guinea-pigs exposed to an aeosol of histamine).

Hydroxylase specific activity was found to increase with increasing protein concentration in a manner consistent with a reversible association of the components in the complex. There was a substantial kinetic lag phase for palmitate hydroxylation which was abolished by a substrate preincubation in the absence of NADPH. The substrate bound and presumably activated the hydroxylase complex without the formation of a substrate-derived intermediated. The oxidation of NADPH and the hydroxylation of palmitate were found to occur in a one to one molar ration, independent of the protein concentration. Finally, a cytochrome P-450 component of the complex was identified on the basis of its CO-binding difference spectrum.

From the plots of log VH+ against pH and log VH+/KH+m against pH one functional group with pK = 7.0 and two functional groups with pK = 9.1 were identified. These groups are involved in substrate binding. Another group with pK = 8.8 was found, which in its unprotonated form catalyses substrate conversion. 2. GSH inhibits the alkaline phosphatase reversibly and non-competitively by attacking the bound Zn(II). 3. The influence of the H+ concentration on the activation by Mg2+ ions of alkaline pig kidney phosphate was investigated between pH 8.4 and 10.0. The binding of substrate and activating Mg2+ ions occurs independently at all pH values between 8.4 and 10.0. The activation mechanism is not affected by the H+ concentration. The Mg2+ ions are bound by a functional group with a pK of 10.15. 4. A scheme is proposed for the reaction between enzyme, substrate, Mg2+ and H+ and the overall rate equation is derived. 5.

Each group consisted of 25 patients and was equally distributed regarding age, severity and stage of hypertension. In the first group (group 1), the mean upright plasma renin activity was 0.8 ng ml-1h-1 (range 0.3 to 1.5) and the patients were considered to have low renin hypertension. In the other group (group 2) the patients had a mean plasma renin activity of 2.1 ng ml-1h-1 (range 1.1 to 5.1) and were considered to have normal to high renin hypertension. In both groups the patients were initially treated with beta-blocking drugs; in group 1 with a beta-blocker corresponding to an average dose of 311 mg propranolol a day for at least eight weeks and in group 2 with propranolol 320 mg a day in a fixed dose for eight weeks. The hypotensive response differed significantly between the two groups (p less than 0.001). In group 1 the pretreatment blood pressure was 197/117 mm Hg supine and 198/120 mm Hg standing. During treatment blood pressure decreased only 5/3 mm Hg supine and 9/5 mm Hg standing. The pretreatment blood pressure in group 2 was 187/114 mm Hg supine and 186/117 mm Hg standing. Beta-blocking therapy reduced blood pressure 36/23 and 34/18 mm Hg, respectively (both p less than 0.001). Pulse rates fell significantly in the two groups, both in the lying and standing positions. In 17 patients with low renin hypertension (group 1), a volume-depleting drug was added (spironolactone, 14 patients; thiazides, 3 patients) and this achieved a marked fall in blood pressure levels of 38/16 mm Hg supine and 37/19 mm Hg standing (both p less than 0.001). These results suggest the following: (1) Most patients with normal to high plasma renin activity respond well to moderate doses of propranolol. (2) Propranolol given in the same doses is almost without antihypertensive effect in patients with low renin hypertension. (3) A volume factor may be operating in patients with low renin hypertension since a hypotensive effect is demonstrated after the addition of volume-depleting drugs.

In mice and rats the compound exhibited marked 5-HT potentiating properties both in vivo and in vitro, being 5-10 times as active as chlorimipramine. The tests included 5-HT-, 5-HTP- and tryptophan-potentiation. In monoamine oxidase inhibitor treated dogs and rabbits the compound caused a marked hyperthermia. In rabbits this effect was completely blocked by pretreatment with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, p-chlorophenylalanine. Hyperthermia induced by the central catecholamine displacing substance H 77/77 in rats was not affected by Lu 10-171, whereas the substance abolished the temperature rise induced by H 75/12. Reserpine- and tetrabenazine-induced ptosis and tetrabenazine-induced immobility in mice were antagonized by relatively low doses of existing tricyclic thymoleptics, whereas Lu 10-171 was very weak in this respect. Very weak in vitro anticholinergic and antihistaminergic properties were also registered for Lu 10-171. It is concluded that Lu 10-171 is a very potent and highly specific potentiator of 5-HT both in vivo and in vitro probably due to inhibition of 5-HT uptake. Thus this compound might be a useful agent in studying the role of 5-HT neurone systems in the control of mood.

The activation induced by Tween 20 and \"zero net charge\" phospholipid liposomes was not pH dependent. On the other hand, linear polyanions and polyanionic liposomes strongly perturbed the pH profile, mostly at low ionic strength, by shifting the pH optimum about 1.7 pH units towards alkaline pH values. This effect was reversed by increasing ionic strength. These observations are interpreted in the light of polyelectrolyte theory. Since these results show striking with membrane-bound enzyme, it is concluded that in vivo cytochrome oxidase is located within polyanionic sites of the micochondrial membrane.

Porphyria followed the administration of hexachlorobenzene in doses of 280 mumol - kg-1 body weight, which were given daily through a gastric tube over a 20-day period. Serum gamma-GT activity and the activities of the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and alpha-mannosidase were increased, whereas L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase remained unaltered. There was a considerable increase in liver microsomal protein, gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450, anilinehydroxylase, aminopyrine-demethylase and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase. In the liver gamma-GT was detected in the microsomes as well as in the cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher. The high correlation coefficient between liver gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450 and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase witnesses a hexachlorobenzene-induced gamma-GT formation in the liver. A statistically significant correlation between serum and liver gamma-GT activity was also found. These data strongly suggest that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity may result from the induction of the enzyme in the liver.", "pmid": "233", "mesh_set": "D000118 D000818 D006581 D008099 D008361 D011164 D011166 D011817 D005723", "score": 18.462542, "rank": 2859, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

A considerable activity is also associated with mitochondrial constituents. Maximal protein binding (nmol/mg): CCl4: 2.8 (0.5 hrs); CHCl3: 11.5 (6 hrs); halothane: 5 (6 hrs). Lipid binding: CCl4: 6.4 (5 min); CHCl3: 8 (4 hrs); halothane: 13.5 (2 hrs). The form of the binding curves in microsomal and mitochondrial protein and lipid differed with the individual haloalkanes. 2) The irreversible (covalent) binding of 14C from labeled haloalkanes in anaerobic suspensions of isolated rabbit liver microsomes and NADPH after 30 min was for protein (lipid) (nmol/mg): CCl4: 15 (58); CHCl3: 3.4 (3.2); halothane: 2.3 (10); trichlorofluoromethane: 6.5 (30). Anerobic incubation favored dehalogenation, but CHCl3 metabolism and irreversible binding requires oxygen. The greatest differences in the in vitro \"covalent\" binding rates were observed with CHCl3 in rat, mouse, and rabbit. 3) Altered microsomal cytochrome P-450 concentrations in newborn animals, or produced by pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), or CoCl2 effected similar, but not proportional changes in the rates of irreversible protein and lipid binding. Upon addition of CCl4 the difference of light absorption of reduced liver microsomes from MC-pretreated rats containing cytochrome P-448 appeared at 452 nm. The irreversible binding rate in these microsomes was also increased. The small accleration in irreversible binding in liver microsomes from rats pretreated with isopropanol is not proportional to the high increase of CCl4 toxicity. 4) Practically no binding to added, soluble albumin or RNA was observed in microsomal incubates.

The rate rate of loss of O6-methylguanine from brain DNA was considerably slower than from liver DNA; tumours have been found in both organs after administration of MNU and other alkylnitrosoureas. There was no difference in the rate of excision from cerebral DNA of A/J and C3HeB/FeJ mice, although these strains differ significantly in their susceptibility to the neurooncogenic effect of MNU and related carcinogens. Excision of O6-methylguanine from hepatic DNA was significantly slower in A/J than in C3HeB/FeJ mice; both strains habe been found to develop hepatic carcinomas following MNU administration. Seven days after the injection of 3H-MNU, O6-methylguanine concentrations were highest in brain and lung DNA, lowest in the liver, and intermediate in kidney, spleen, small intestine and stomach. The lung is a principal target organ for tumour induction by MNU and other carcinogens in mice; however, neural tumours are usually induced at a low incidence. The results obtained do not contradict the hypothesis that O6-alkylation of guanine in DNA is a critical event in the initiation of tumour induction by alkylating agents.

A comparison of total radioactivity vs. unchanged drug in rat plasma after administration of 3H-digoxin clearly showed the need to separate digoxin from its metabolites. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin were therefore examined using solvent extraction and thin-layer chromatography to isolate unchanged drug. Digoxin levels after a 1 mg/kg iv dose were measured in the plasma and urine of adult male rats in which the bile duct or the ureters had been ligated, as well as in sham-operated controls. In all cases, digoxin concentrations were best described by a two-compartment open model. Digoxin was rapidly eliminated from the plasma of controls, with a half-life of 2.5 hr, a volume of distribution of 3.6 liter/kg, and a renal clearance somewhat lower than the glomerular filtration rate. No significant change in these parameters was observed in rats with bile duct ligation. The total body clearance of 5.77 ml/min in the controls was reduced by only 10% in the bile duct-ligated rats. In animals with bilateral ureter ligation, the body clearance was reduced by 30% and the plasma half-life of digoxin was increased to 4 hr, although no significant change in the apparent volume of distribution was noted. Approximately 60% of the total body clearance was unaffected by bile duct and ureter ligations, and was assumed to be due to biotransformation.

The maintenance of this sexually undifferentiated activity level is a function of the thyroid gland, the adrenals and of growth hormone (somatotropin) and prolactin. Removal of the thyroid or the adrenals from intact animals decreases the activity and eliminates the sexual difference. Following the substitution of hypophysectomized animals with different hypophyseal hormones or gonadotropin preparations, only growth hormone and prolactin are effective in causing an increase in the very low activity.

Bufetolol (10(-5) to 10(-4) g/ml) and propranolol (10(-6) g/ml) significantly decreased the maximum rate of rise of the action potential. The maximum responsive frequency to driving stimulus was decreased in the presence of bufetolol (3 X 10(-5) g/ml) and propranolol (10(-5 g/ml), whereas the effective refractory period was not affected. The critical threshold potential was shifted to more positive potential in the presence of the drugs. The passive membrane property, the space constant (lambda), the time constant (tau) and the current-voltage relations of the muscle membrane were not significantly altered by the drugs. It is concluded that bufetolol and propranolol suppress the excitability of the muscle membrane and this action may be ascribed to the decrease in the sodium conductance (gNa) and to the rise of gNa onset potential without alteration in the passive membrane property.", "pmid": "15153", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000319 D000818 D000889 D004285 D004558 D006329 D066298 D008564 D010210 D011412 D011433 D012033", "score": 13.517095, "rank": 5256, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The spinal cords of 107 rats were studied with light and electron microscopy 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days postoperative (DPO). Spinal cord hemisected animals developed a dense cicatrix at the site of lesion replete with connective tissue, blood vessles, and myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibres which could be traced to peripheral sources. Rostrally at the C.N.S.--cicatrix interface, there were reactive neuroglial cells, occasional nerve fibres and finger-like projections of spinal cord (due to cavitation lesions) which contained neuroglia, axons and dendrites. Implantation of saline in Gel-foam resulted in the same morphology as in hemisected animals except for increased lesion size due to mechanical factors and decreased cicatrix density during the first 30 DPO. Puromycin treatment resulted in a cicatrix with initial decreased cell density but which contained a new class of nerve fibres at 30 DPO. These nerve fibres were oriented in a rostro-caudal direction, were unmyelinated, 0.1-0.2 micron in diameter and had expanded smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Some of these nerve fibres were degenerating at 30 DPO and all were absent by 60 DPO. The puromycin-treated spinal cord within 200 micron rostral to the basal lamina contained nerve terminal conglomerates, which resembled boutons, in fascicles from 30-90 DPO (duration of experiment). Hemisection of the spinal cord by crushing 1-1 1/2 segments rostral to the site of puromycin implantation at 30 DPO resulted in degeneration of these nerve fibres in the cicatrix as well as the degeneration of nerve terminal conglomerates just rostral to the basal lamina. The regenerative capacity of the spinal cord is discussed in relationship to these findings.", "pmid": "274521", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002818 D004343 D008297 D008854 D009416 D011691 D051381 D013116", "score": 14.914288, "rank": 4652, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Simultaneously the glycogen mobilization after massive glucagon stimulation, was successivly diminished and finally abolished in different groups with increasing tumor weight. Concomitantly the spontaneous and stimulated activity of liver phosphorylase a was found markedly reduced in advanced tumour cachexia, the extent of stimulation of liver phosphorylase a activity by intracardial injections of epinephrine not being altered. Tumour induced inhibition of glycogen mobilization thus appears to have been excluded. To account for the relative late pronounced hypoglycemia in peripherial rat blood in face of the early loss of liver glycogen, accelerated gluconeogenesis has been postulated. In accord with this spontaneous rise in liver tyrosine amino transferase was found in tumour bearing rats along with a doubled maximal stimulation value after medrol injection as compared to control groups. This behavior could not be shown for liver alanine aminotransferase and liver fructose 1,6-di-phosphatase. The former showed no differences between control and tumour groups neither of spontaneous nor of stimulated activity.

Regulation of DAHP synthetase by phenylalanine and tyrosine in these mutants did not change at all, but the specific activities of the mutant cell extracts increased 1.3- to 2.8-fold, as reported previously (1). Chorismate mutase activities in both the wild and the mutant strains were cumulatively inhibited by phenylalanine and tyrosine and recovered with tryptophan, while the specific activities of the mutants increased 1.3- to 2.8-fold, like those of DAHP synthetase. On the other hand, the specific activities of prephenate dehydratase in the mutant and wild strains were similar, when tyrosine was present. While prephenate dehydratase of the wild strain was inhibited by phenylalanine, tryptophan, and several phenylalanine analogues, the mutant enzymes were not inhibited at all but were activated by these effectors. Tyrosine activated the mutant enzymes much more strongly than the wild-type enzyme: in mutant 221-43, 1 mM tyrosine caused 28-fold activation. Km and the activation constant for tyrosine were slightly altered to a half and 6-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme, respectively, while the activation constants for phenylalanine and tryptophan were 500-fold higher than the respective inhibition constants of the wild-type enzyme. The molecular weight of the mutant enzyme was estimated to be 1.2 x 10(5), a half of that of the wild-type enzyme. The molecular weight of the mutant enzyme was estimated to be 1.2 X 10(5) a half of that of the wild type enzyme, while in the presence of tyrosine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan, it increased to that of the wild-type enzyme. Immediately after the mutant enzyme had been activated by tyrosine and then the tyrosine removed, it still showed about 10-fold higher specific activity than before the activation by tyrosine. However, on standing in ice the activity gradually fell to the initial level before the activation by tyrosine. Ammonium sulfate promoted the decrease of the activity. On the basis of these results, regulatory mechanisms for phenylalanine biosynthesis in vivo as well as mechanisms for the phenylalanine overproduction in the mutants are discussed.", "pmid": "7552", "mesh_set": "D010723 D001951 D002826 D006836 D007700 D008970 D009154 D010649 D011302 D014364 D014443", "score": 27.981512, "rank": 642, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Since in the presence of exogenous CO2 and HCO3- the pH stat-measured rate of mucosal (M) acidification underestimates JH by the rate of electroneutral HCO3- secretion, the reverse short-circuit current (RSCC) applied across ouabain-treated bladders was used to estimate JH. That the RSCC is a measure of JH was demonstrated by: 1) in the absence of added CO2 and HCO3- the rate of M acidification totally accounted for the RSCC, and 2) increases in RSCC with CO2 addition occurred without changes in Na+ and K+ fluxes or the coupled ration of HCO3- secretion for Cl-absorption. When serosal (S) percent CO2 was progressively progressively increased JH achieved a maximum rate of 64 +/- 3 muA (SE) with 4.5% CO2. At higher S percent CO2 JH did not change, suggesting that factors other than the rate of CO2 hydration were rate limiting. The maximum rate of JH was not decreased by low concentrations of CA inhibitors (acetazolamide, 5 X 10(-5) M), although the percent CO2 at which this maximum rate occurred increased to 8.5%. The increased percent CO2 requirement for the maximum rate of JH with low concentrations of CA inhibitors suggests that these agents alter JH by decreasing the rate of enzymatic CO2 hydration. At high concentrations (acetazolamide, 5 X 10(-4) M) these inhibitors decrease the maximum rate of JH in the presence of CO2, implying that these inhibitors at higher concentrations directly interfere with the H+ transport system.", "pmid": "8996", "mesh_set": "D000086 D000818 D001639 D002245 D002256 D002712 D005016 D006859 D006863 D010042 D014426 D001743", "score": 12.7056875, "rank": 5552, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Of special interest were the distinct networks of varying densities in the amygdaloid cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the prepiriform cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the (pre-)frontal cortex. Their distribution is identical with the patterns observed in recent studies on cortical dopamine nerve terminals using certain modifications of the Falck-Hillarp technique.

{"title": "Proton inactivation of Ca2+ transport by sarcoplasmic reticulum.", "abstract": "The effects of acid on fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum from rabbit white skeletal muscle have been studied. Brief exposure of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes to pH values in the range 5.5 to 6.0 at 37 degrees caused rapid inactivation of calcium accumulation measured at 25 degrees in the presence of oxalate (calcium uptake) while (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) activity was enhanced by 75%. ATPase activity, measured at 37 degrees in the absence of oxalate and in the calcium steady state, was unaltered when calcium uptake was inactivated. Calcium efflux from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, previously loaded passibely with 45CaCl2, was only slightly increased when calcium uptake was abolished. At still lower pH values, 5.0 to 5.5, (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase was inactivated while Mg2+ ATPase was more acid-resistant. Acid inactivation of calcium uptake followed simple first order kinetics for at least 80% of the time course. The rate constant, k, increased from 0.043 min-1 to 1.63 min-1 between pH 6.50 and pH 5.35. At pH 4.65, Ea, the energy of activation, was 31 kcal mol-1 between 24 degrees and 43 degrees. Inactivation, once initiated, was irreversible. Aged suspensions of sarcoplasmic reticulum were more sensitive to acid inactivation. Ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid enhanced inactivation, and calcium specifically protected against inactivation with half-maximal effect at 1 to 2 mM. The sulfhydryl reagent, dithiothreitol (1 mM), caused significantly increased rates of inactivation. Calcium binding was studied by dual wavelength spectrophotometry and stopped flow analysis. Acid inactivation distinguished two ATP-induced binding sites, previously described (Entman, M. L., Snow, T. R., Freed, D., and Schwartz, A. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7762-7772) as a superficial Mg2+-independent Site A which binds and releases calcium rapidly and a deeper Mg2+-dependent Site B which binds and releases calcium more slowly. Rates of binding to both sites were decreased by acid inactivation. Binding of calcium to Site A increased, however, from 4.6 to 6.4 nmol mg of protein-1 whereas that to Site B decreased from 17.0 to 6.9 nmol mg of protein-1. Passive binding of calcium to sites of medium affinity (K = 7 X 10(4) M-1) was unaffected by acid inactivation of calcium uptake. Temperature dependence of (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase was unchanged in the range 9-34 degrees.

The increase with age in succinate dehydrogenase and glutaminase was restricted to free mitochondria while hexokinase and malate NADP dehydrogenase accumulated and beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase diminished in both fractions. In adult brain, too, where the above ratios became 7.5, 5.2, 3.5, 0.84, 1.4, and 2.0, respectively, the concentrations of enzymes relative to each other distinguished clearly between free and synaptic mitochondria.

One percent cholesterol was added to a casein-sucrose-soybean oil basal diet for rats or a stock diet with 2% soybean oil for guinea pigs. The effect of vitamin E and cholestyramine was also examined in some experiments. Cholesterol feeding increased the rate of lipid peroxidation in liver and aortic homogenate both in rats and guinea pigs when fed non-vitamin E supplemented basal diets. Vitamin E supplementation prevented the increase in the aorta, but not as completely in the liver in rats, while the reverse was true in guinea pigs. The effect of cholestyramine was dependent on the level of vitamin E in the diet. Cholesterol feeding decreased glutathione peroxidase activities in rats and guinea pigs. In guinea pigs, cholesterol feeding also markedly decreased liver microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation, codein hydroxylation and cytochrome P-450 levels especially when fed non-vitamin E supplemented basal diets. In rats, cholesterol feeding reduced liver microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation and in some cases, increased microsomal codeine hydroxylation activities, but had no effect on microsomal cytochrome P-450 levels.

Rat liver TAT is also separated into three peaks by hydroxylapatite. Each fraction gives only one peak of activity when electrofocussed separately. In the frog, three groups of peaks of TAT activity have been separated by hydroxylapatite column chromatography. The first group is connected with ASAT activity. These peaks (pI's 6.35, 6.50 and 6.90) are heat stable and have a Km value for tyrosine of 4 mM. These fractions probably represent cytoplasmic ASAT (sASAT).

DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively. For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment. Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress, proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly, Su-13437 stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins. The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives. These are the same as those found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after allyl isopropyl acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy. A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration, [14C]leucine incorporation into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase, and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver, characterize the trophic effect of the drug used.

{"title": "Contraction and recovery of living muscles studies by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance.", "abstract": "1. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance ((31)P NMR) can be used to measure the concentrations of phosphorus-containing metabolites within living tissue. We have developed methods for maintaining muscles in physiological condition, stimulating them and recording tension while at the same time accumulating their (31)P NMR spectra. Experiments were performed on frog sartorii and frog and toad gastrocnemii at 4 degrees C.2. The NMR signals from (31)P (the naturally occurring phosphorus) is weak, and signal averaging is required. In order to follow the time course of reactions it is necessary to maintain the muscles in a steady state for many hours while they are undergoing repeated contractions. Signals were accumulated in separate computer bins according to time after initiation of contraction. By these means spectra were obtained which corresponded to the different intervals during the contraction and recovery cycle.3. In the absence of stimulation, the spectra of frog sartorius muscles and of their extracts indicated concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphoryl creatine (PCr), inorganic orthophosphate (P(i)) and sugar phosphates (sugar P) which are in reasonable agreement with the values obtained by chemical analysis.4. We have confirmed that unidentified resonances representing unknown compounds appear in the spectra of both frog and toad muscle; one of these is much larger in spectra from toad than from frog. We have found an additional small, unidentified resonance which appears to be specific to toad muscle.5. Spectra accumulated during actual contractions (1 s tetani every 2 min) did not differ dramatically from those accumulated throughout the 2 min cycle of contraction and partial recovery.6. Following 25 s tetanii, approximately 20% of the PCr had been hydrolysed; it was then rebuilt exponentially with a half-time of about 10 min. The increase in [P(i)] immediately after contraction and the time course of its disappearance corresponded to the changes in [PCr]. During the later half of the recovery period the concentration of P(i) was reduced to below that in resting muscle. The [sugar P] remained very high ( approximately 4 mmol kg(-1)) throughout the 56 min interval between contractions.7. When frog sartorii were tetanized for 1 s every 2 min, the changes in [PCr] and [P(i)] between contractions could not be observed because too little signal was obtained from these small muscles. However, when toad gastrocnemii were similarly stimulated, the changes in these compounds could be readily detected and were even greater than expected.8. The position of the P(i) resonance can be used to monitor intracellular pH and changes in pH. Under the conditions of our experiments the average intracellular pH in unstimulated frog sartorius muscles was 7.5. After a 25 s tetanus this was observed to move in the acid direction by a few tenths of a pH unit and to return to its pre-stimulation value before the end of the recovery period. After a 1 s contraction of toad gastrocnemius the environment of P(i) became slightly more alkaline for the first few seconds.", "pmid": "17739", "mesh_set": "D000255 D000818 D002023 D006863 D066298 D007554 D009682 D009119 D009132 D010710 D010725 D010758 D011896", "score": 14.720447, "rank": 4745, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Equilibrium constants were high (2.8-11.7 X 10(8) M-1) and varied as a function of aggregate size. The maximum number of A-IgG bound per cell varied from 230,000 for A-IgG9 to 90,000 for A-IgG74. Binding was 50% inhibited by near physiological concentrations of monomeric IgC. These data suggest that A-IgG are bound at multiple sites by attachment of Fc frgments to Fc receptors present on the macrophage surface with larger A-IgG being more avidly bound. Dissociation was slower for larger A-IgG while no clear trend was seen relating associating rates and aggregate size. Thus, differences in the avidity of binding of A-IgG are due primarily to slower dissociation of larger A-IgG. Dissociationissociation of A-IgG was slower from cells exposed initially to higher doses of A-IgG and dissociation did not follow simple first order kinetics. Thus, the avidity of binding appears to be heterogeneous in a population of similar sized A-IgG. As expected, association was dose-dependent, more rapid than dissociation, and followed pseudo first order kinetics. Based on all of the above data, it is proposed that binding of A-IgG proceeds in two steps. First, A-IgG are loosely bound to perhaps a single Fc receptor. Then, depending upon the availability and mobility of Fc receptors, additional Fc fragments are attached and the A-IgG becomes more firmly attached. Thus binding is slow, but once attached A-IgG are avidly held.", "pmid": "859000", "mesh_set": "D000818 D000936 D001202 D001665 D002462 D004306 D007141 D007074 D007700 D008264 D008297 D008970 D051381", "score": 13.417193, "rank": 5296, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The mutants do not require glutamine for growth on glucose--ammonia medium but do have altered growth on other nitrogen sources. They grow better than an isogenic control on media containing arginine or asparate, but more slowly with proline or alanine as nitrogen sources. This unusual growth pattern is not due to altered regulation of the ammonia assimilatory enzymes, glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase, or to changes in the enzymes for aspartate degradation. However, transport for several amino acids may be affected. Measurement of amino acid uptake show that the mutants with high glutamine synthetase levels have increased rates for glutamine, arginine, aspartate, and lysine, but a decreased rate for proline. The relationship between glutamine synthetase levels and uptake  was examined in two mutants with reduced, rather than increased, glutamine synthetase production. The uptake rates for glutamine and lysine were lower in these two glutamine auxotrophs than in the Gln+ controls. These results show a correlation between the glutamine synthetase levels and the uptake rates for several amino acids.

Labilization of cytosol proteins occurred much earlier than any change in the level of protein synthesis or lysosomal enzyme activity. The data showing increased susceptibility to proteolysis could not be explained either by the presence of endogenous proteases, by the destruction of the exogenous proteases used in the assay, or by the existence of protease inhibitors. Nor were any differences detected either in the distribution of radioactive precursor among the cytosol proteins from growing or regressing tumors or in the electrophoretic pattern of the same proteins. Preincubation of the cytosol proteins with dithiothreitol or with prolactin, 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, and hydrocortisone did not modify the susceptibility to proteolysis.

Differential modulation by testosterone and metabolites of testosterone.", "abstract": "The final step in the biosynthesis of testosterone is the reduction of androstenedione, which is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme 17-ketosteroid reductase. Evidence is presented which suggests that there are two distinct 17-ketosteroid reductases in rat testes, one in interstitial tissue and one in seminiferous tubules. The two enzymes have different pH optima, 5.6 for the one from interstitial tissue and 6.5 for the one from seminiferous tubules. At the optimum pH, a 70-fold difference in Km values was observed, 17 muM for the interstitial tissue enzyme and 0.25 muM for the enzyme from seminiferous tubules. Testosterone and metabolites of testosterone have very different effects of each of these enzyme activities. The interstitial tissue enzyme activity is inhibited by testosterone and several 5alpha-reduced metabolites of testosterone and by estrogens. The most potent inhibitor of the steroids investigated was 5alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol, followed by 17beta-estradiol approximately equal to dihydrotestosterone greater than testosterone greater than estrone greater than estriol. 5alpha-Androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol and 17beta-estradiol were shown to act by competitive inhibition with apparent Ki values of 2.2 and 3.7 muM, respectively. In contrast, it was demonstrated that among the above steroids, only dihydrotestosterone inhibits the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules and this inhibition was only observed at very high concentrations of inhibitor. Testosterone stimulated the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules. 5alpha-Androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity from seminiferous tubules, while it had no effect at high concentrations. The remainder of the steroids tested had no effect on the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules.

Over 2000 blood samples were taken, and the changes in plasma levels of FSH, LH and testosterone were related to the cycle of testicular activity. During long days plasma levels of gonadotrophins became very low and the testes regressed to about 20% of their maximum size; there was a corresponding reduction in plasma testosterone levels. When the rams were returned to short days reproductive development was again stimulated after 2-3 weeks with a progressive increase in plasma FSH and LH levels and consequent hypertrophy of the testes. It took about 16 weeks of short days for testicular activity to become maximal. Blood samples collected at hourly intervals for 24 h on ten occasions during the study revealed transitory peaks in plasma FSH and LH levels indicative of episodic release. Changes in gonadotrophin secretion were modulated primarily by alterations in the frequency of episodic releas; less than 1 spike per 24 h during long days increased to a maximum of 10 spikes/24 h under short daylengths. The peaks of FSH release were of smaller amplitude than those of LH, although during periods of frequent episodic release basal levels of fsh were increased to a greater extent than those of LH. A circadian rhythm was observed in the plasma levels of FSH, LH and testosterone, which was related to increased gonadotrophin release during the dark phase of the 24 h cycle; changes in blood haematocrit were also observed. The circadian changes appeared to be correlated with the activity cycle of the animals which in turn was dictated by daylight.

Doses of d-amphetamine that increased the conversion of 3H-tyrosine to 3H-dopamine in the brain were found to decrease food intake, an effect that was reduced by the systemic administration of the dopaminergic antagonists alpha-methyltyrosine, haloperidol or spiroperidol. The dopaminergic agonists, apomorphine, dopa, cocaine and methylphenidated, also reduced feeding and these effects were attenuated by low doses of spiroperidol. In larger doses, spiroperidol itself decreased feeding, and this effect was potentiated by alpha-methyltyrosine. The ability of dopaminergic agonists and antagonists to inhibit food intake was also observed in rats treated with 6-hhyroxydopamine so as to produce a selective 83% depletion of dopamine. In these animals, d-amphetamine was found to be less effective as an anorexic agent, whereas dopa, apomorphine, alpha-methyltyrosine and spiroperidol each was more effective in reducing food intake. These alterations in sensitivity may reflect neurochemical changes which occur at residual dopaminergic synapses after subtotal lesions of dopaminergic neurons.

This compound was characterized by (a) chromatographic behavior, (b) chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, (c) phosphorus content, and (d) incorporation of [5-3H]ara-C and [methyl-14C]choline. Formation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine diphosphate choline by RPMI 6410 cells was enhanced in the presence of 3-deazauridine (DU) and was preceded by that of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate. The antiproliferative effects of ara-C and DU toward RPMI 6410 cells were potentiated when the agents were present together. The anabolism of ara-C during a 24-hr interval of culture was markedly enhanced by the presence of DU; cellular concentrations of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine diphosphate choline were 5- and 15-fold higher than those in the absence of DU. This enhancement appears to be the basis of the potentiation of cytotoxicity resulting from combination of the agents.

In this communication, we demonstrate that beta-bungarotoxin is a potent phospholipase A2 (phosphatide 2-acyl hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.4), comparable in activity with purified phospholipase enzymes from Naja naja and Vipera russellii. The phospholipase activity of beta-bungarotoxin requires calcium and is stimulated by deoxycholate. When strontium replaces calcium, no phospholipase activity is detected. Since neuromuscular transmission is not blocked when calcium is replaced by strontium, it was possible to examine the effects of the toxin on neuromuscular transmission in the presence of strontium. Under these conditions, when the phospholipase activity should be inhibited, the toxin has little or no effect on neuromuscular transmission. If beta-bungarotoxin owes its toxicity in part to its enzymatic activity, then it must be placed in a different class from those toxins which produce their effect by binding passively to an appropriate receptor.", "pmid": "1749", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002038 D002118 D004789 D009469 D018377 D010740 D051381 D013324 D013569", "score": 16.681845, "rank": 3738, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The amino acid incorporating activity of cell-free systems with polysomes or mitochondria from newborn brain exceeds that of adult controls significantly in contrast to a smaller incorporating rate of labelled amino acids into synaptosomal protein. Addition of polysomes isolated from newborn brain increases the amino acid incorporation by cell-free systems with adult brain tRNA and enzymes, whereas the polysomes from adult brain decrease the incorporating activity of newborn brain systems. The loading capacity of newborn brain tRNA exceeds that of the adult controls and the velocities of its aminoacylation are four times faster. Uncharged as well as precharged newborn brain tRNA increases the amino acid incorporating activity of tRNA-dependent cell-free systems with adult brain polysomes and enzymes. In contrast to polysomes and tRNA, the newborn brain enzymes involved in protein synthesis seem to be less active in cell-free amino acid incorporation than the enzyme fractions from adult brain.

Transport occurred against a concentration gradient and required the expenditure of energy supplied by metabolic reactions that were inhibited by catalytic amounts of sodium azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol. The process exhibited both pH and temperature dependence with optima at pH 4 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The energy of activation and Q10 for transport were calculated to be 18,227 cal/mole and 2.82 respectively, between 20 and 30 degrees C. The kinetics of the system were consistent with a mechanism of transport that depended upon a finite number of sites on the cell surface and had a Kt of 1.46 x 10(-5) M. The system for L-glycine transport lacked sterospecificity and was most inhibited in the presence of other neutral amino acids while less inhibition was observed in the presence of the acidic and basic amino acids.

The cerebellar cGMP content increases after isoniazid; this response remains unchanged in rats pretreated with 3-AP. Since isoniazid decreases cerebellar gamma-aminobuturic acid (GABA) levels, the increase in cGMP content might reflect a reduction in the availability of GABA at the level of postsynaptic receptors. Apomorphine (a dopamine receptor agonist) and haloperidol (a dopamine receptor blocker) increase or decrease the cGMP content of cerebellar cortex, respectively. Neither drug changes the guanylate cyclase activity of cerebellar homogenates; moreover their action on cerebellar cGMP content persists after 3-AP. Chloropromazine, like haloperidol, decreases the cerebellar cGMP content. The increase in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by apomorphine can be differentiated from that elicited by harmaline or isoniazid; presumably apomorphine indirectly activates mossy fibers. The decrease in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by haloperidol can be differentiated from that elicited by diazepam; perhaps haloperidol reduces the mossy fiber input to the cerebellum. We suggest that the cGMP content of cerebellar cortex fluctuates in response to changes in the afferent stimulatory input to the cerebellum; it increases when the activity of either climbing or mossy fibers is increased; it decreases when either of these two stimulatory inputs is reduced.", "pmid": "13199", "mesh_set": "D000470 D000818 D001058 D002525 D000242 D006152 D003975 D006162 D006220 D006246 D007538 D008297 D011725 D051381 D014282", "score": 32.636612, "rank": 352, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Maximum stimulation is observed at protease concentrations ranging from 3 to 10 mug/ml. Higher protease concentrations inhibit ovarian adenylate cyclase in a dose-dependent manner. Protease stimulation causes a 6- to 8-fold increase in adenylate cyclase activity, which is comparable to the stimulation observed with human chorionic gonadotropin. Combinations of trypsin plus hormone or trypsin plus NaF stimulate ovarian adenylate cyclase activity to a greater extent than does any one of these alone. The mechanism of protease stimulation of adenylate cyclase involves limited proteolysis because zymogen precursors fail to activate the cyclase as does trypsin pretreated with trypsin inhibitors. Unlike cholera toxin, the serine protease stimulation is immediate (within the first 5 min) and requires no additional factors (e.g., NAD(+)). It is unlikely that protease stimulation of adenylate cyclase results from a proteolytic modification of the hormone receptor on the cell surface, because of the additive effects noted above and because protease stimulation is also observed in ovaries desensitized to hormone that lack this hormone receptor. Results with Lubrol-treated membranes also suggest that proteolytic enzymes do not directly activate the catalytic subunit of the cyclase or unmask new catalytic sites because the protease effect (like hormonal stimulation) is abolished by the detergent, whereas fluoride stimulation is enhanced. Other data suggest that serine protease and chorionic gonadotropin stimulation of adenylate cyclase result from activation of a membrane protease that then regulates adenylate cyclase in the ovary.", "pmid": "270717", "mesh_set": "D000262 D000818 D006063 D004347 D004789 D005029 D005260 D066298 D010053 D010447 D051381 D012969 D013229 D013997 D014357", "score": 26.514633, "rank": 816, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Exposure to 15 degrees C did not affect the rectal temperature but exposure to 35 degrees C produced hyperthermia. At 15 and 25 degrees C, 20 mug GABA produced hyperthermia which was longer lasting at the former ambient temperature. GABA (20 mug) prevented the hyperthermic effect of exposure to 35 degrees C and produced hypothermia in animals maintained at this temperature for 1 hr.

The activities of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (dopa D), tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase were examined; in addition the tissue levels of dopa, 3-O-methyldopa, dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined. In the non-dopa-treated Parkinsonian patients, the greatest decreases were detected for striatal DA and dopa D, with homovanillic acid and tyrosine hydroxylase levels showing a lesser change. The activities of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase in the striatal nuclei were not different from the controls. The putamen was consistently the most severely affected region. Dopa and 3-O-methyldopa were detectable in all brain areas only in those patients treated with L-dopa shortly before death. The mean concentrations of DA in the striatum of these patients were 1) 9 to 15 times higher than those in non-dopa-treated patients, 2) related to the time before death of the last dose of L-dopa and 3) greater in the striatum of patients clinically classified as \"good responders\" as compared to \"poor responders.\" Although L-dopa therapy increased homovanillic acid levels in all brain areas, a preferential increase was observed in the striatum.

Despite this apparent requirement for bifunctionality, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoureas bearing a single alkylating function were found to cross-link DNA in vitro. Cross-linking was demonstrated by showing inhibition of alkali-induced strand separation. Extensive cross-linking was observed in DNA treated with 1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, and 1-(2-chloroethyl(-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea. The reaction occurs in two steps, an intital binding followed by a second step which can proceed after removal of unbound drug. It is suggested that the first step is chloroethylation of a nucleophilic site on one strand and that the second step involves displacement of Cl- by a nucleophilic site on the opposite strand, resulting in an ethyl bridge between the strands. Consistent with this possibility, 1-(2-fluoroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea produced much less cross-linking, as expected from the known low activity of F-, compared with Cl-, as leaving group. 1-Methyl-1-nitrosourea, which is known to depurinate DNA, produced no detectable cross-linking.", "pmid": "851960", "mesh_set": "D002330 D055598 D002621 D004247 D007700 D008130 D008770 D009607", "score": 18.20893, "rank": 2967, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Tilting so that the receptor cell was excited produced a depolarizing receptor potential which, if large enough, could generate action potentials. 3. Large fluctuations in membrane potential were evident during depolarizing receptor potentials and were reduced or sometimes absent when a cell was tilted upward. Power-density spectra of the noise voltage revealed that most of the energy added by downward tilt is contained in frequency components below 3 Hz. 4. Removing synaptic input to the receptor cells by cutting the statocyst nerve or adding excess Mg2+ to the bath did not abolish the increase in fluctuations caused by downward, excitatory tilts. 5. The depolarizing receptor potential was often associated with a decrease in membrane resistance as measured with constant current pulses using a bridge circuit. 6.

Epinephrine produced significant mitotic inhibition (49%) at a concentration as low as 4.5 X 10(-10) M, while its analog, isoproterenol, produced 47% inhibition at 1 X 10(-10) M. Norepinephrine elicited a 49% inhibitory response at 1 X 10(-8) M. One other catecholamine, dopamine, caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at 1 X 10(-6) M. Other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were phenylephrine, 58% at 1 X 10(-7) M; octopamine, 47% at 1 X 10(-5) M; and tyramine, 52% at 1 X 10(-4) M. Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system. The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis. When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol.

Transmucosal electric potential difference (PD) and net fluxes of H(+) and Na(+) were determined for luminal [H(+)] from 20 to 160 mM and [Na(+)] from 1 to 140 mM ([H(+)] and [Na(+)] were varied reciprocally). The PD was 50-60 mV lumen negative and was constant over the entire range of Na(+) and H(+) concentration tested. Net H(+) flux varied linearly with [H(+)]. Extrapolation indicated apparent H(+) loss at zero luminal concentration, suggesting a basal HCO(3) (-) secretion. Addition of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or taurocholate decreased the PD to 30-40 mV and increased threefold the slope of the relation between net H(+) flux and [H(+)] (k(H)). Calculation of PD-independent permeability constants for H(+) (P(H)) with the Goldman constant field equation indicated that this increase in k(H) could not be attributed solely to the associated decrease in PD. Prednisolone administered for 3 doses had no effect on either the basal mucosal permeability to H(+) or the altered permeability induced by ASA or taurocholate. Chronic administration induced a low rate of basal acid secretion (at 12 wk) but had no effect on either PD or k(H). However, the increase in k(H) and P(H) that developed upon addition of ASA or taurocholate in chronically treated dogs was more than one and a half times that of controls.

The results show that the transfer of oxygens from Pi to glutamine is the most rapid of the measured isotopic interchanges, over five oxygens from Pi being transferred to glutamine for each glutamate formed by net reaction. Under similar conditions, the oxygen transfer from Pi to glutamate, was stimulated somewhat by an increase in the glutamate concentration but inhibited by an increase in the ammonia concentration. The enzyme from brain or peas did not show the rapid transfer of 18O from Pi to glutamine shown by the E. coli enzyme. Deductions are also made from the data about the availability of the oxygens of gamma-carboxyl of bound glutamate for reaction. The most logical explanation of the results with the E. coli enzyme is that the gamma-carboxyl group of bound glutamate has sufficient rotational freedom so that under conditions of rapid substrate interconversion either carboxylate oxygen can participate in the reaction. The results with the pea enzyme are consistent with hindered rotation of the gamma-care additional findings make likely a relative order of certain catalytic steps for the E. coli enzyme as follows: ATP release less than NH3 release less than glutamate release less than substrate interconversion less than glutamine release and Pi release and glutamate release less than ADP release.", "pmid": "9391", "mesh_set": "D000641 D000818 D001921 D004926 D005974 D005971 D005973 D007700 D010710 D010944 D012756 D013045", "score": 20.367022, "rank": 2125, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

When the P815 target cells rather than the CTL's were exposed to heat their susceptibility to immune lysis was not affected even after treatment times that were lethal to the tumor cells. Despite the dissimilar heat sensitivities of CTL and P815 cells, the dose-response curves for inhibition of protein synthesis by heat, as indicated by [3H]leucine incorporation, were similar for both cell types: neither the depression of protein synthesis in heated CTL's nor the decreased cytolytic ability of these cells was reversed within 3 hr.

Invest. 52, 823-834) was investigated using human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell cultures in serum-free medium. Plaminogen activator activity ratios (trypsin-activated/ untreated controls) in HEK cell-conditioned media were maximal (up to 3) during the first week of culture and remained nearly constant at approximatley 2 for the next 3-5 weeks, while the total plasminogen activator titer increased in a nearly linear manner. Therefore, coincident with progressive cell degeneration and death, the ratios decreased to near unity due to \"spontaneous\" activation of the enzyme, which was inhibited in cell-free conditioned media by the pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz and benzamidine. Since the activator is not inhibited by the trypsin inhibitor, it is concluded that a protease other than the plasminogen activator is responsible for the activation. Increases in the plasminogen activator titers (about 2-fold) were similarly obtained by culturing the cells in medium containing low concentrations (0.05-0.10 mug/ml) of trypsin for up to about 6 weeks. The presence of the trypsin inhibitor in HEK cells cultures decreased the rate of activation, resulting in higher activity ratios (up to 6), and the total plasminogen activator activity was reduced only minimally (less than 20%), if at all, by the highest concentration of the trypsin inhibitor (100 mug/ml) tested. Affinity chromatography of conditioned media with activity ratios of 1.6--2 separated the plasminogen activator into an active fraction and a fraction which was activated a minimum of 200-fold by trypsin and contained no measurable activity prior to activation. Gel filtration of crude conditioned media or partially purified activator separated the plasminogen activator into two peaks; both were trypsin-activatable, and their relative proportions varied with the isolated conditions.

Hyperfunctioning tissues from one patient with secondary parathyroid hyperplasia, four patients with parathyroid adenomas, and one patient with parathyroid carcinoma were incubated in media containing low calcium (0.75 mM), normal calcium (1.5 mM), high calcium (3.0 mM), or vinblastine (0.01 mM), a microtubular disrupter. Also, in order to correlate ultrastructural responses with PTH secretion, after incubation tissues of one adenoma were objectively quantitated by stereologic techniques. Low calcium consistently stimulated mean PTH secretion from hyperplastic and adenomatous tissue, but only during the 1st hour of secretion. Low calcium inconsistently stimulated carcinomatous tissue. High calcium suppressed mean PTH release from all tissues. Vinblastine did not consistently inhibit secretion from adenomatous or hyperplastic tissue. Ultrastructural analysis of adenomatous tissue showed a sparsity of granules (0.87 per cent of cellular volume) compared to previously studied bovine tissues. Low calcium significantly increased the volume fraction of pinocytotic vesicles to 300 per cent (p less than 0.01) and reduced the surface area of straight (inactive) membrane to 60 per cent (p less than 0.01) of the normal calcium control. Secretion granules, when present, were adjacent to submembrane vesicles. The number and structure of microtubules were not changed by low or high calcium or vinblastine. Our findings indicate that parathyroid adenomas and hyperplastic tissues can respond acutely to low calcium stimulation and high calcium suppression. However, the acute response to low calcium stimulation may not be sustained in some cases because of limited storage of hormone. The increase in pinocytosis in low calcium-stimulated tissue suggests a coupling of exocytosis with membrane endocytosis, possibly related to membrane recycling.

The dose-response curve for the chronotropic action of phenylephrine was parallel to that of isoprenaline, whilst the dose-response curve for the inotropic action of phenylephrine was less steep than that of isoprenaline.3 The infusion of pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, at a rate of 1 mug/min, shifted the isoprenaline dose-response curves to the right, and to the same extent, in both papillary muscle and sinus node preparations. In contrast to isoprenaline, the antagonism of phenylephrine by pindolol was noncompetitive. Phentolamine did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of phenylephrine.4 On isolated ventricular strips alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by 10(-6) M phentolamine did not affect dose-response curves to phenylephrine or dopamine. Pindolol shifted the dopamine dose-response curves to the right in a competitive manner and those of phenylephrine in a noncompetitive manner.5 On ventricular strips from reserpine-pretreated dogs phenylephrine and tyramine dose-response curves were shifted markedly to the right and downwards. Desipramine (10(-5) M) which enhanced the action of noradrenaline considerably reduced the myocardial responses of phenylephrine.6 Papaverine (10(-5) M) decreased the threshold concentration of phenylephrine required to stimulate the myocardium and shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the left.7 Raising the temperature from 32 degrees C to 37 degrees C shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right; when the temperature was raised from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C the affinity of the drug was not changed.8 Other alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, methoxamine and clonidine, decreased the active tension of ventricular strips. The responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline (in the presence of pindolol; 3 x 10(-8) M) were not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M).9 The results indicate that adrenoceptors mediating positive inotropic responses in the dog ventricle are of the beta-type and that post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved.

This was observed when assays were carried out in the presence of sodium deoxycholate, after microsomes were treated wtih phospholipase C, or at pH 10.3 and after microsomes were subjected to nitrogen cavitation. The apparent Km of inosine-5'-diphosphatase for IDP was unchanged when microsomes were treated with phospholipase C or at pH 10.3 after both these treatments approximately 85% of the enzyme remained bound to the membrane. In contrast, when microsomes were treated with phospholipase C or at pH 10.3 after both these treatments approximately 85% of the enzyme remained bound to the membrane. In contrast, when microsomes were treated with sodium deoxycholate or subjected to nitrogen cavitation, approximately 75% of the inosine-5'-diphosphatase activity was released from the membrane, and the apparent Km of the enzyme for IDP increased 4- and 2-fold, respectively. Microsomal cisternae were loaded with lead phosphate by incubation with glucose-6-P and Pb2+, and the release of this lead phosphate following the addition of EDTA to the medium was determined to estimate the permeability of the microsomal membrane. When microsomes were treated with sodium deoxycholate, phospholipase C, or at alkaline pH, the microsomal membrane became almost completely permeable to EDTA under conditions where there was little or no increase in the activity of inosine-5'-diphosphatase. Microsomes were treated at pH 10.3 and then adjusted slowly to pH 7.5. The activity of inosine-5'-diphosphatase decreased to the same activity observed in untreated preparations.

Each of the compounds was rapidly taken up by the liver from the circulating perfusate. After 4 hr of perfusion, biliary excretion of 14C from 1-CB, 2-CB, 5-CB, and 6-CB was 48.2, 29.6, 20.5, and 1.3% of total dose, respectively. For 1-CB, this rate of biliary elimination represents a maximum perfusate/bile ratio of 107. About 97% of the label in the bile from 1-CB experiments was in the form of metabolites. Biliary excretion of 1-CB was biphasic: an initial rapid phase (t 1/2 = 13 min) was followed by a slower second phase (t 1/2 = 122 min). When the metabolites of 1-CB were added to the perfusate, biliary excretion of these metabolites was monophasic; t 1/2 = 120 min, which corresponded to the slower phase observed when the parent compound was presented to the liver. 1-CB disappeared from the perfusate via a biphasic process. Metabolites of 1-CB effused into the perfusate immediately after the initial rapid uptake of 1-CB by the liver, and the recirculating pool of metabolites was eliminated in the bile by the slow postsynthetic phase of biliary elimination. Less than 2% of 1-CB was present as the parent compound in the perfusion system after 4 hr of perfusion.

The enzyme showed some activity in the absence of FDP, with a pH optimum of 8.2; FDP decreased the Km for both pyruvate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and shifted the pH optimum to 6.9. Enzyme activity showed a hyperbolic response to both NADH and pyruvate in all the buffers tried except phosphate buffer, in which the response to increasing NADH was sigmoidal. The FDP concentration required for half-maximal velocity (FDP0.5V) was markedly influenced by the nature of the assay buffer used. Thus the FDP0.5V was 0.002 mM in 90 mM triethanolamine buffer, 0.2 mM in 90 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethanemaleate buffer, and 4.4 mM in 90 mM phosphate buffer. Phosphate inhibition of FDP binding is not a general property of streptococcal lactate dehydrogenase, since the FDP0.5V value for S. faecalis 8043 lactate dehydrogenase was not increased by phosphate. The S. faecalis and S. lactis lactate dehydrogenases also differed in that Mn2+ enhanced FDP binding in S. faecalis but had no effect on the S. lactis dehydrogenase. The FDP concentration (12 to 15 mM) found in S. lactis cells during logarithmic growth on a high-carbohydrate (3% lactose) medium would be adequate to give almost complete activation of the lactate dehydrogenase even if the high FDP0.5V value found in 90 mM phosphate were similar to the FDP requirement in vivo.", "pmid": "17595", "mesh_set": "D004789 D005636 D006863 D007700 D007770 D013294 D008345 D009243 D010710 D011773", "score": 23.995443, "rank": 1189, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

For these data, we calculated \"corrected specific radioactivity,\" adjusted for changes in pool size. This adjustment is only a first approximation since, for example, the free leucine pool is not uniform with respect to protein synthesis. The four N-nitroso compounds that decreased specific radioactivity also decreased corrected specific radioactivity, even though they enlarged the leucine pool.

{"title": "The influence of pH on equilibrium effects of tetrodotoxin on myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta.", "abstract": "1. The experiments were done on single nodes of Ranvier of Rana esculenta. The effects of tetrodotoxin and H ions were determined either by the reduction of the maximum rate of rise, VA, of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or in the voltage clamp by the decrease of the peak Na permeability, PNa. 2. With the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium dissociation constant, KT, of the toxin-receptor reaction at neutral pH was determined to be 2-8 nM. Between 1-55 and 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin the normalized value, A, of VA, was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration cT = [TTX]/2-8 nM by the empirical equation log [(1-A)/A] = 1-22 log cT-0-573. 3. On increasing the pH (up to 8-8) the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed by an increase in A. The apparent reduction of cT (as calculated from A) suggests that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms. 4. Weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions (7-3 less than pH less than or equal to 5-5) reduced A to a lesser degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing effect of acid pH on A (A = 0-5 at about pH 5-5). In more acid toxin solutions A decreased again and at pH 4-6 it was about equal to the value in toxin-free solution. 5. When, after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution, the perfusate was suddenly changed to neutral Ringer solution A jumped to a higher value A' as measured 1 sec after the switch. Since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin washout is of the order of 1 min, A' reflects the number of Na channels blocked by tetrodotoxin at acid pH. 6. In acid toxin-free solution the peak PNa as obtained in voltage clamp experiments was reduced by a voltage-dependent factor (cH + 1)-1 with CH = [H+]/KH(E) and KH(E) = 2-04 muM exp (0-34 EF/RT). Adding tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor p'T. 7. Experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration (3-1-93 nM) and pH values (7-3-5-2) confirm the decreased toxin effect at low pH. Moreover, p'T was smaller (the additional toxin effect larger) when the membrane had been kept depolarized and thus cH reduced during equilibration. This suggests that tetrodotoxin cations and H ions compete for the same blocking site.

However, the ovulation response was not different between the groups. In ovariectomized estradiol benzoate (EB)-treated, androgen-sterilized rats, serum LH concentrations 15 and 60 min after LH-RH injection were lower than in similarly treated control rats. This effect was not secondary to the anovulatory state of the animal, since it also occurred in ovariectomized EB-treated prepuberal rats and in rats ovariectomized prepuberally and treated with EB in adulthood. Also, after treatment with 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone propionate (5alpha-DHTP), pituitary responsiveness to LH-RH in androgen-sterilized rats was lower than in control rats, which suggests that the subnormal response in the estrogen-treated rats was not due to a relative insensitivity to estrogen in the androgen-sterilized rats. The relatively high pituitary responsiveness to LH-RH in intact androgen-sterilized rats is probably due to the high circulating estrogen levels.

Skin excised between the domes in the denervated nerve field appeared normal when compared to innervated skin, and it was considered unlikely that the alterations in dome structure were due to generalized nutritional changes in the skin caused by transection of sympathetic axons or to some other side effect of denervation.

Separation of the protein moiety of these particles by acid-urea gel electrophoresis depends on the concentration of beta-mercaptoethanol in the buffer used for the solubilization of the particles. At low concentration or with short time of solubilization, only a polypeptide chain with apparent molecular weight 38 000 penetrates into the gel and can be detected by electrophoresis. By introduction of two-dimensional polyacrylamine gel electrophoresis, we succeeded to separate the protein moiety of these particles into a core group of 4 major and 6 minor polypeptides with molecular weights ranging from 38 000 to 50 000 and a second group of 19 polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 50 000 to 120 000. The composition of the protein moiety of these particles is dependent on the extent of purification. Polypeptides with molecular weight below 50 000 represent 55% of the total protein of particles purified only by centrifugation through a 15-30% sucrose gradient. If the particles were first  purified by gel filtration through Bio-Gel A-50m followed by centrifugation in sucrose gradient, the low molecular weight proteins represent 80% of all the proteins of the particles. The purification removed selectively the minor high molecular weight polypeptides without resulting in any extensive release of the four major polypeptides with molecular weight below 50 000 which form a stable core particle. By repeated purification it is possible to strip the particles of the high molecular weight polypeptides even further. An increase in the NaCl concentration of the extraction buffer to 0.35 M will extract additional 30-40-S particles associated with a newly synthesized RNA from the cell nucleus.

Glucose uptake was mediated by two transport systems; the apparent Km of the high-affinity system was 1.8 muM and that of the low-affinity system was 34 muM. Free glucose accumulated within prosthecae at a concentration 60 to 200 times above that present externally, depending on the Km of the system being observed. The glucose transport system in prosthecae was stereospecific for D-glucose, and neither methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside nor 2-deoxyglucose was transported. Uptake of glucose was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), and the inhibition by PCMB but not by NEM was reversed by dithiothreitol. Glucose uptake was also inhibited by the uncoupling agents 5-chloro-3-t-butyl-2'-nitrosalicylanilide (S-13), 5-chloro-3-(p-chlorophenyl)-4'-chlorosalicylanilide (S-6), and carbonyl-cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and by the respiratory inhibitor KCN. Efflux of glucose from preloaded prosthecae was induced by PCMB and KCN, but not by S-13 or CCCP. Glucose uptake was not affected by arsenate or an inhibitor of membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatases, N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The lack of inhibition by these two compounds, combined with the extremely low levels of adenosine 5'-triphosphate present in prosthecae, indicates that adenosine 5'-triphosphate is not involved in the transport of glucose by prosthecae.", "pmid": "4425", "mesh_set": "D000255 D001149 D001419 D001693 D002729 D003486 D004024 D004229 D005033 D005947 D006863 D009005 D013237 D013696 D013772 D014475", "score": 14.84092, "rank": 4685, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

This phospholipase activity (phosphatidylacylhydrolase EC 3.1.1.4) exhibited an apparent bimodal pH optimum (pH 6.0 and pH 7.5) and was Ca(2+)-dependent; Mg(2+) and monovalent cations (Na(+) and K(+)) did not substitute for Ca(2+) in the reaction; EDTA was a potent inhibitor. The phospholipase hydrolyzed 1-[1-(14)C]palmitoyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine to form only radio-active lysophosphatidylethanolamine as the product, indicating that the enzyme had phospholipase A(2) specificity. The phospholipase A(2) was purified 302-fold by two successive chromatographic steps on carboxymethyl Sephadex. Gel filtration (Sephadex G75) of the purified enzyme resulted in a single peak of biological activity with a molecular weight of approximately 14,800. The same estimate of molecular weight was obtained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which yielded a single band. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this fraction at pH 4.3 revealed a single protein band migrating beyond lysozyme, with the dye front, suggesting that this protein was more basic than lysozyme (pI 10.5).

When theophylline (10(-3) M) was added to the culture medium of these cells, rates of lipid synthesis from acetate and activities of synthetase and carboxylase became distinctly lower than in cells that were untreated. This effect appeared after approximately 12 h, and after 48 h enzymatic activities were reduced approx. 2-fold and rates of lipid synthesis from acetate 3- to 4-fold. The likelihood that the decrease in fatty acid synthesis from acetate was caused by the decrease in activities of fatty acid synthetase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase was established by several observations. These indicated that the locus of the effect probably did not reside at the level of acetate uptake into the cell, alterations in acetate pool sizes or conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA. Moreover, de novo fatty acid synthesis was found to be the predominant pathway in these glial cells, whether treated with theophylline or not. The mechanism of the effect of theophylline on fatty acid synthetase was shown by immunochemical techniques to involve an alteration in content of enzyme rather than in catalytic efficiency. The change in content of fatty acid synthetase was shown by isotopic-immunochemical experiments to involve a decrease in synthesis of the enzyme. The mechanism whereby theophylline leads to a decrease in lipogenesis and in the synthesis of fatty acid synthetase may not be mediated entirely by inhibition of phosphodiesterase and an increase in cyclic AMP levels, because dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-3) M) only partially reproduced the effect.", "pmid": "7298", "mesh_set": "D000103 D003994 D002460 D064429 D005227 D007700 D008025 D009457 D013261 D013806", "score": 23.58874, "rank": 1271, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The systems for transport and hydrolysis of lactose had the characteristics of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent lactose (Lac) phosphotransferase (PT) system and phospho-beta-galactosidase (P-beta-gal), respectively, in all strains tested, except strain HS6. Decryptified cells required PEP and Mg(2+) for transport of the non-metabolizable model beta-galactosides o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and thiomethyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (TMG). Substitution of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) for PEP also stimulated the Lac PT system. Other potential high-energy phosphate donors (adenosine tri-, di-, and monophosphates and guanosine triphosphate) did not stimulate the Lac PT system. Sodium fluoride had no effect upon the PEP-dependent Lac PT system in decryptified cells with PEP as the energy source; however, when 2-PG was used as the energy source, F(-) inhibited ONPG phosphorylation. With intact cells which must generate PEP endogenously, the presence of F(-) in concentration >/= 10 mM completely inhibited the Lac PT system, presumably through inhibition of 2-PG hydrolyase (EC 4.2.1.11; enolase). Both intact and decryptified cells accumulated a phosphorylated derivative of TMG that behaved chromatographically as TMG-phosphate. After alkaline phosphatase treatment, the derivative had an R(f) identical to that of TMG. No beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity was detected with ONPG as the substrate; hydrolysis occurred only when ONPG-6-phosphate was supplied as the substrate. Strain HS6 apparently transported lactose by an active transport-type system in which the accumulated intracellular product was the free disaccharide based on the following criteria: (i) ONPG transport and hydrolysis in decryptified cells was not stimulated by PEP; (ii) ONPG hydrolysis occurred in the absence of PEP; and (iii) ONPG-6-phosphate was not hydrolyzed. These data indicate that, in all strains tested except strain HS6, lactose transport was mediated by a PEP-dependent Lac PT system, resulting in accumulation of lactose-phosphate that was hydrolyzed by an enzyme similar to the P-beta-gal of group N streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus; conversely, strain HS6 transported and hydrolyzed lactose by a PEP-independent transport system and beta-gal, respectively.", "pmid": "246429", "mesh_set": "D001692 D003470 D004790 D005459 D005690 D007785 D008756 D009598 D010728 D010731 D010770 D013295", "score": 12.435983, "rank": 5640, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

To extend these findings clinically, within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction, 11 patients underwent continuous 10 hour Holter monitoring: 2.5 hour control before and after 5 hour constant edrophonium infusion (0.25 to 2.00 mg./minute). Continuous infusion of the agent lowered heart rate 92 to 78 b.p.m. (p less than 0.01). Although mean total ventricular extrasystoles (PVC's) per 5 hours per patient (131) and PVC's per 1,000 beats (4.7) were unchanged (p greater than 0.05), potentially lethal tachyarrhythmias (malignant PVC's: multifocal, R on T, paried, greater than 5 per minute or ventricular tachycardia) were terminated in six of 10 patients by edrophonium. However, serious ventricular arrhythmias continued in three patients and appeared in four despite the agent. Ventricular fibrillation did not occur during the 10 hour period of study. In addition, the patients were evaluated hemodynamically and by His bundle electrograms before and after a 10 mg. bolus of edrophonium prior to the 10 hour constant infusion: heart rate declined (88 to 72 b.p.m., p less than 0.01), while mean arterial pressure (98 mm. Hg), left ventricular filling pressure (14 mm. Hg), cardiac index (2.4 L. per minute per square meter), and stroke work index (36 Gm.m./M.2) were unchanged (p greater than 0.05). The edrophonium bolus prolonged the A-H interval (117 to 135 msec., p less than 0.01) while the H-Q interval was unaltered (48 msec; p greater than 0.05). It is concluded that increased vagal tone with edrophonium did not reduce the over-all presence of premature ventricular contractions in the entire study group; however, the malignant nature of PVCs and ventricular tachycardia appeared to be lessened by the parasympathomimetic agent in certain patients.

The effect of high (54 mM) potassium concentration on intact ganglia seems to result in a dual action: a) a specific induction of TH and DBH via release of acetylcholine from preganglionic cholinergic nerve terminals. b) a non-specific effect on terminal adrenergic neurons resulting in a general increase of protein synthesis as indicated by the increase in DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities. In decentralized superior cervical ganglia potassium depolarization failed to produce the specific TH and DBH induction although a small increase in DDC activity persisted. Carbamylcholine, acetylcholine and nicotine at concentrations of 10(-4) M elicited a selective induction of TH and DBH both in intact and decentralized ganglia via nicotinic receptor stimulation. Bethanechol, predominantly stimulating muscarinic receptors had no significant effect on TH activity. A 4 h pulse of 10(-4) M carbamylcholine produced optimal induction of DBH and TH 24 h and 48 h later respectively.

Tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions: fasted for 24 hr, fasted and refed with glucose or corn-oil, fasted and administered glycerol intramuscularly, and nonfasted. 2. The changes in the contents of glycolytic intermediates in the livers indicated that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [EC 4.1.1.32] reaction is inhibited by tryptophan administration in all groups of rats. The inversely related changes in the contents of malate and phosphoenolpyruvate were associated with the accumulation of quinolinate in the livers. The content of quinolinate which exhibited the half-maximal effect on the contents of both metabolites was 0.1-0.2 mumole per g liver. 3. The rate of incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into the total hepatic fatty acids was increased about 2-fold by the administration of this amino acid to the fasted rats. The enhancement of the rate was closely related to the increase in the citrate content. The hyperlipogenesis was also related to the decrease of acetyl-CoA and the increase of malonyl-CoA. The content of long-chain acyl-CoA was not affected. These effects of tryptophan administration on the hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups of rats. The liver content of glycerol 3-phosphate was decreased by tryptophan administration was markedly increased by glycerol injection. The injection of glycerol into the control and the tryptophan-treated rats produced a marked increase of glycerol 3-phosphate but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the livers of either group. 4.

All drugs were injected intra-arterially.2 All the four drugs decreased tracheal intraluminal pressure (tracheal relaxation) and increased tracheal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner. The four drugs produced a dose-dependent increase in developed tension of papillary muscles. In both preparations the duration of action of isoprenaline and salbutamol was short, whereas that of OPC-2009 and trimetoquinol was long. These effects were antagonized by propranolol.3 Dose-response curves to the four drugs for tracheal relaxation were almost parallel. OPC-2009 was 2.4 times more potent, and trimetoquinol and salbutamol were 2.2 and 6.2 times less potent than isoprenaline in causing tracheal relaxation.4 Dose-response curves to the four drugs for tracheal vasodilatation were also parallel. OPC-2009, trimetoquinol and salbutamol were 3.9, 6.7 and 23 times less potent than isoprenaline.5 Slopes of the dose-response curves to the four drugs for increased developed tension were not parallel; that of OPC-2009 was the least steep, whereas that of isoprenaline was the steepest. Trimetoquinol, salbutamol and OPC-2009 were about 18, 570 and 2400 times less potent than isoprenaline.6 Selectivity calculated from relative potencies indicate that OPC-2009 was about 6000 times, salbutamol about 92 times and trimetoquinol about 8.2 times more selective than isoprenaline for tracheal smooth muscle as compared to ventricular muscle.7 The high potency and selectivity of OPC-2009 for tracheal smooth muscle and its long duration of action suggest its potential usefulness for treatment of bronchial asthma.8 The present results are also compatible with the concept that beta(1)-adrenoceptors in cardiac muscle and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in tracheal and vascular smooth muscle can be distinguished.

Particular attention is paid to monitoring the functional status and maintaining optimal diffusion conditions. A steady net acid efflux of the order of 250 n mole/g-min is found in the resting state. This increases following a series of isometric contractions. In the resting state the total measured lactate + pyruvate efflux was found to be less than the net acid efflux. The net acid efflux increases following a sudden decrease in pCO2 and decreases or reverses following a sudden increase in pCO2 or a decrease in external bicarbonate. The net base loss during a period of 1 h following the exposure to high (20%) CO2 represents a large fraction of the predicted total bicarbonate generated within the fibres by non-bicarbonate buffers. This indicates that the effects of intracellular non-bicarbonate buffers can be transmitted to the external solution following a change in pCO2.

Characteristic impedance was lower in the normal subjects (group A, average 53 dyn sec cm-5) than in the subjects with coronary artery disease (groups B and C, average 129 dyn sec cm-5).

{"title": "Withdrawal of clonidine: effects of varying dosage or duration of treatment on subsequent blood pressure and heart rate responses.", "abstract": "The influence of the dosage or duration of treatment on the incidence and severity of clonidine withdrawal responses was examined in normotensive rats. Clonidine (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg i.m.) was administered either in single doses, or twice daily for 3 days or 3 weeks. Rats were then anesthetized and arterial catheters were inserted. Significant overshoots in blood pressure and heart rate, reaching peak values 16 to 26 hr after the last injection, occurred in all clonidine-treated rats, but in no control rats. The overshoots after single injections of clonidine were as great as those after suspension of sustained treatment. Moreover, withdrawal responses were as great after the low dose as they were after the 10-fold greater dose. Only plasma renin activity showed a significantly greater elevation during withdrawal of the high dose of clonidine. Since ganglionic blockade reduced blood pressures and heart rates to the same levels in rats with clonidine withdrawal hypertension as in control rats, the withdrawal overshoots appear to be nervously mediated. Neither the dosage nor the duration of treatment could be shown to determine the magnitude of the response to withdrawal of clonidine.", "pmid": "28415", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001794 D003000 D005730 D006339 D006801 D051381 D012083 D013375 D013997", "score": 18.709461, "rank": 2756, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Peroxidation, in vivo, was monitored by the evolution of ethane, an autoxidation product of omega-3-unsaturated fatty acids. Weanling rats were fed a basal diet low in vitamin E, Se, and sulfur-containing amino acids, or diets individually supplemented with these factors. After 3 to 7 weeks, the rats were injected with CCL4 (ip) and ethane was collected for 9 hours. Cumulative ethane evolution was increased by CCl4 in all groups. Vitamin E, Se, and methionine reduced ethane evolution from CCl4-treated rats by 82%, 74%, and 60%, respectively. The toxicity of CCl4 was decreased in correlation with ethane evolution. Thus, methionine and Se, probably by maintaining intracellular glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, protected against CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation, as did vitamin E. Substitution of cod liver oil, which is rich in omega-3-unsaturated fat, for lard in the basal diet increased CCl4-induced ethane evolution six-fold. Relative inhibition by the dietary supplements was not changed.

{"title": "Derepression of amino acid transport by amino acid starvation in rat hepatoma cells.", "abstract": "Amino acid starvation causes an adaptive increase in the initial rate of transport of selected neutral amino acids in an established line of rat hepatoma cells in tissue culture. After a lag of 30 min, the initial rate of transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) increases to a maximum after 4 to 6 h starvation of 2 to 3 times that seen in control cells. The increased rate of transport is accompanied by an increase in the Vmax and a modest decrease in the Km for this transport system, and is reversed by readdition of amino acids. The enhancement is specific for amino acids transported by the A or alanine-preferring system (AIB, glycine, proline); uptake of amino acids transported by the L or leucine-preferring system (threonine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine) or the Ly+ system for dibasci amino acids (lysine) is decreased under these conditions. Amino acids which compete with AIB for transport also prevent the starvation-induced increase in AIB transport; amino acids which do not compete fail to prevent the enhancement. Paradoxically threonine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, which do not compete with AIB for transport, block the enhancement of transport upon amino acid starvation. The starvation-induced enhancement of amino acid transport does not appear to be the result of a release from transinhibition. After 30 min of amino acid starvation, AIB transport is either unchanged or slightly decreased even though amino acid pools are already depleted. Furthermore, loading cells with high concentrations of a single amino acid following a period of amino acid starvation fails to prevent the enhancement of AIB transport, whereas incubation of the cells with the single amino acid for the entire duration of amino acid starvation prevents the enhancement; intracellular amino acid pools are similar under both conditions. The enhancement of amino acid transport requires concomitant RNA and protein synthesis, consistent with the view that the adaptive increase reflects an increased amount of a rate-limiting protein involved in the transport process. Dexamethasone, which dramatically inhibits AIB transport in cells incubated in amino acid-containing medium, both blocks the starvation-induced increase in AIB transport, and causes a time-dependent decrease in transport velocity in cells whose transport has previously been enhanced by starvation.", "pmid": "16007", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000621 D001692 D006528 D002460 D003907 D004790 D007700 D008113 D009374 D013329 D014444", "score": 26.432428, "rank": 828, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The apparent Michaelis constants for acetoacetyl CoA and NADPH were 8.3 and 21 micrometer, respectively. The enzyme was markedly inhibited by acetoacetyl CoA at concentrations higher than 10 micrometer. The incorporation of [1-14C]acetyl CoA into poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) by bacterial crude extract (containing beta-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl CoA reductases, enoyl CoA hydratases and PHB synthases) or by a system reconstituted from purified preparations of beta-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl CoA reductase and PHB synthase, was observed only in the presence of NADPH, but not NADH.

Following oral administration, 50% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the urine in four days; 8-14% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug. The fecal specimens accounted for 5-9% of the dose. Following intravenous administration an initial rapid elimination of drug from the plasma was observed [(t1/2)alpha approximately 0.4 hr, (t1/2)beta approximately 4 hr]. The data are consistent with the rapid elimination of radioactivity, approximately 30% of dose, in the urine during the first 24 hr, followed by a much slower rate of excretion of drug and metabolites. These findings are congruous with the high affinity (greater than 98%) of MK-196 and the major metabolite with plasma proteins. The urinary metabolites were isolated and identified by the following techniques: solvent extraction, column, thin-layer, and gas-liquid chromatography, derivatization, and mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The major metabolite, which resulted from para-hydroxylation of the 2-phenyl substitutent, accounted for about 40% of the urinary radioactivity. Reduction of the ketone group, methylation of the p-hydroxy group, and additional phenyl ring hydroxylation were also shown to occur.

Lergotrile and bromocriptine are almost equipotent in competing for the binding of H3-apomorphine to rat striatal membranes, but bromocriptine is more potent in competing for the binding of H3-haloperidol than lergotrile. These results indicate that lergotrile and bromocriptine are mixed putative agonist-antagonist with respect to the postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Lergotrile and bromocriptine at higher concentrations inhibit synaptosomal tyrosine hydroxylase activity, and reverse the apomorphine elicited enzyme inhibition. Thus, these ergot alkaloids behave as mixed agonist-antagonist also with respect to the presynaptic dopamine receptors. Bromocriptine and lergotrile, as well as other tested DH-ergot alkaloids and neuroleptics, compete for the binding of the alpha-antagonist H3-WB-4101 to rat cerebral cortical membranes. The displacing potencies of the tested DH-ergot alkaloids and of the neuroleptics indicate that they have a high affinity for the alpha-adrenoreceptors in the CNS.", "pmid": "21229", "mesh_set": "D000097 D000316 D000317 D000818 D001058 D001665 D001921 D001971 D002069 D002417 D002540 D003342 D004088 D004298 D004873 D006220 D066298 D009994 D051381 D011941 D011942 D013574 D014446", "score": 36.88586, "rank": 208, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "positive/labeled"}

{"title": "Chemical synthesis of an octanucleotide complementary to a portion of the cohesive end of P2 DNA and studies on the stability of duplex formation with P2 DNA.", "abstract": "A pyrimidine octanucleotide complementary to one of the cohesive ends of P2 DNA was chemically synthesized. Its sequence, d(C-T-T-T-C-C-C-C-OH), was verified by labeling it at the 5' end, followed by partial enzyme digestion and separation by a two-dimensional fingerprinting system. A single ribo-G residue was added to its 3' end using calf thymus deoxynucleotidyl terminal transferase. The resulting nonanucleotide primer was used in a detailed study on the stability of the duplexes formed in the partial as well as complete repair synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerase I, at 5 degrees C in the presence of 70 mM potassium phosphate and 70 mM NaCl. The nonanucleotide primer was able to form a stable duplex with P2 DNA template only in the presence of DNA polymerase I. When the chain lengths of pyrimidine oligonucleotides were varied from 4 to 8 to test their abilities to serve as primers for the enzymatic repair synthesis, it was revealed that the minimum length required for the primer function is 8. Using the nonanucleotide as the primer and the right-hand cohesive end of the DNA as the template, repair synthesis was initiated simultaneously at the 3' end of the primer as well as at the right-hand 3' end of the DNA. This resulted in a decrease in the efficiency of repair synthesis at the 3' end of the primer, possibly due to the displacement of the primer by the enzyme. The enzyme was unable to displace the primer, when the primer was extended to a 13-mer prior to the initiation of repair synthesis at the 3'-OH end of the DNA. These data suggest that the strand displacement by DNA polymerase I at 5 degrees C in the presence of 70 mM potassium phosphate and 70 mM NaCl is not significant when the duplex is at least 13 nucleotides long. The efficiency of the repair synthesis at the 3'-OH end of the DNA-primer duplex could be increased by blocking the repair synthesis at the 3'-OH end of the DNA by converting it to 3'- phosphate. This method could be useful in DNA sequence analysis, where such specific repair synthesis is desired.", "pmid": "857884", "mesh_set": "D001483 D003090 D004256 D004260 D004279 D009838 D009841 D013698", "score": 15.961638, "rank": 4100, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Effects of adrenoceptor stimulating and blocking agents on carotid body chemosensory inhibition.", "abstract": "1. The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on chemosensory discharges originating from carotid bodies in situ were studied in anaesthetized cats.2. Noradrenaline (NA) injections commonly resulted in increased frequency of carotid nerve chemosensory discharge, an effect ascribed to reduced blood flow through the glomus, and reduced or eliminated by alpha-adrenergic block.3. NA injections occasionally produced an initial reduction of chemosensory discharge frequency, which was however less intense and of shorter duration than that caused by dopamine. This effect of NA is not mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors, since it is not blocked by dibenamine, but probably by low affinity for dopamine receptors.4. Dopamine and apomorphine-elicited chemosensory inhibition were not affected by low doses of phenoxybenzamine, which blocked NA-evoked hypertensive reactions.5. Higher doses of phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine produced a displacement to the right of dose-response curves for dopamine- and apormorphine-elicited chemosensory inhibition. However, this interference by alpha-adrenergic blockers was attributed to the resultant hypotension, since it was reversed upon restoration of blood pressure.6. Isoprenaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, did not induce chemosensory inhibition, whilst beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol and dichloroisoproterenol) did not modify dopamine- and apomorphine-elicited chemosensory inhibition.7. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that chemosensory inhibition could be mediated by specific dopamine receptors, distinct from alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.", "pmid": "24116", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000322 D000818 D002344 D002415 D002628 D004305 D009638 D013565", "score": 26.70393, "rank": 794, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Conformation in aqueous medium of the neutral, protonated and anionic forms of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine.", "abstract": "Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed to study the solution conformations of the neutral, protonated and dissociated forms of the therapeutically active 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (araA). In particular, in strongly basic medium, increasing alkalinity led to pronounced changes in chemical shifts and coupling constants of some pentose protons, due to ionization of the pentose hydroxyls, especially the 2'-OH. The neutral form of araA may be characterized as approx. 25% C(2')endo and approx. 60% gauche-gauche, hence somewhat different from that of the therapeutically active 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC). By contrast, the conformations of the anionic forms of both of these are identical, predominantly (greater than 80%) C(2')endo and gauche-gauche. With the aid of the 3'-O-methyl derivatives of araA and araC, where only the 2'-OH ionizes, and the accompanying conformational changes are similar, it follows that the conformation C(2')endo and gauche-gauche for all the foregoing is constrained to this form via a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond, viz. O(5')H...O(2')(-). The influence of the foregoing hydrogen bond on the chemical shifts of the adenine H(8) in the araA anion points to the existence of the latter in the form anti. A similar effect of the doubly ionized phosphate group on H(8) in 5'-araAMP shows the nucleotide to also prefer the form anti, as previously demonstrated for 5'-AMP. The conformations of the sugar rings of the neutral forms of araA and adenosine in aqueous medium differ appreciably, whereas in the solid state they are very similar. PMR spectroscopy is shown to be an effective method for following sugar hydroxyl dissociation. The extent of ionization of a given hydroxyl is provided by the resulting chemical shifts of neighbouring (geminal and vicinal) protons. When ionization is accompanied by a change in conformation, the process may be followed also by changes in proton-proton vicinal coupling constants.", "pmid": "8099", "mesh_set": "D000227 D006863 D009682 D008958 D008968 D011684 D013237 D014740", "score": 11.334771, "rank": 5897, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Tissues were allowed to equilibrate in a Tris-buffered Krebs solution and were then exposed to similar solutions containing up to 5 mM-La. La caused shrinkage and significant losses of tissue K, Na, Mg and Ca. The shrinkage was exactly accountable for by a reduction in the extracellular space (e.c.s.) as measured by [14C]sucrose. No significant change was seen in tissue Cl content. Exposure for 1 hr to 5 mM-La led to a total cation loss of 24-3 +/- 1-6 m-equiv/kg or, correcting for the small change in Cl content, a loss of positive charge of 23-8 +/- 2-2 m-equiv/kg fresh wt. 2. Using the radioisotope 140La it was shown that this loss of cation was balanced by an uptake of La3+. 3. Subtraction of the ions in the measured [14C]sucrose space from the total tissue ion contents led to estimates of the \"cellular\" ion contents. The effects of 1 hr exposure to 5 mM-La on these were a loss of 12-9 +/- 2-4 m-equiv/kg of cation and a gain of 10-0 +/- 2-6 m-equiv/kg of Cl. 4. Similar changes in ion content were produced by La on \"Na-loaded\" and \"K-loaded\" tissues, these being tissues which by exposure to K-free or Na-free (high K) solutions had replaced all their K with Na or vice versa. 5. The uptakes of 24Na and 36Cl by Na-loaded tissues were both describable as the sum of two exponentail processes: a fast component (t 1/2 congruent to 1/2 min), which was presumed to be extracellular and a slower, presumed transmembrane, component. La reduced the rapid component of uptake of 24Na by an amount greater than that predicted by the reduction in the e.c.s., the extra amount lost being some 10--15 m-equiv/kg. La also reduced the amount of rapidly exchanging 36Cl, bwt this reduction was entirely accounted for by the change in the e.c.s. La reduced the rate constant of the slow component of 24Na uptake. 6. La reduced the rapidly exchanging component of 42K uptake by normal tissues by an amount equivalent to about 0-5 m-mole/kg fresh wt. of K in excess of the change in the extracellular space. 7. La had little effect on the effluxes of 36Cl and 42K from normal tissues. However, it reduced the size of the fastest component of exchange of 42K efflux from K-loaded tissues by an amount equal to some 10-15 m-equiv/kg in excess of the reduction in the e.c.s. A similar reduction in the rapidly exchanging component of 24Na efflux from normal tissues was also seen. La slowed the efflux of 24Na from Na-loaded tissues at times when the tracer lost could safely be regarded as intracellular. 8. The taenia coli when exposed to K-free solutions gains Na and loses K. In the presence of La the gain in Na was completely blocked. K was still lost, however, being accompanied by Cl and increased shrinkage.

Tension in 15 solvent-treated controls remained stable during the same observation period. The reduction in tension was greater in the post partum than the pregnant uteri (P greater than 0.05). Sixteen additional uterine strips, excised from 4 pregnant and 4 post partum rabbits were treated either with 500 microng Ibuprofen or solvent for 7.5 minutes.

{"title": "The association between acidification and electrogenic events in the rat proximal jejunum.", "abstract": "1. Simultaneous measurement of hydrogen ion production, transmural potential difference and intermittent short-circuit current (SCC) was made in the rat proximal jejunum in vitro: similarly, potassium and sodium ion movements were measured to investigate the relationship of acidification to electrogenic events and associated ion movements in the jejunum.2. Acidification correlated significantly with the short-circuit current and both were inhibited by 10 mM serosal ouabain or 10 mM mucosal aminophylline. Both inhibitors had effects on net potassium movement but not on net sodium movement. Moreover, in isotope studies whereas 10 mM serosal ouabain reduced the J(ms) sodium flux, 10 mM mucosal aminophylline had no effect, i.e. aminophylline can reduce both short-circuit current and acidification without perceptibly altering the serosally directed sodium flux.3. In low-sodium buffers in which acidification still occurs although reduced, transmural potential differences occur of reversed polarity that are apparently unrelated to sodium diffusion potential differences (as evidenced by isotopic sodium efflux experiments) and which could be caused by hydrogen ion production. In low sodium buffers however the inhibitors have opposing effects, ouabain causing an increase and aminophylline a decrease in the reversed potential differences.4. A model for acidification (that of potassium rather than sodium ion exchange for the hydrogen ion and hydroxyl for chloride ion exchange) is proposed to explain the present experimental findings and other diverse observations in the literature: although either step might be the electrogenic step, acidification must be also considered as a component of the jejunal short-circuit current.", "pmid": "7670", "mesh_set": "D000628 D000818 D001692 D004594 D005947 D006863 D066298 D007583 D008297 D010042 D011188 D051381 D012964 D014867", "score": 18.259138, "rank": 2940, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Tyrosine hydroxylase in the mes- and diencephalon.", "abstract": "The localization and distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the first enzyme in the catecholamine synthesis, in the mes- and diencephalon has been studied with the indirect immunofluorescence technique of Coons and collaborators. Principally, TH was present in neuron systems with a distribution similar to known dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline systems. The present data, taken together with published and some unpublished results, indicate that all parts of most central dopamine neurons, i.e. cell body, dendrites, axon and nerve terminals, appear strongly fluorescent. The adrenaline neurons also appeared strongly fluorescent, except for their axons, which only exhibited a weak fluorescence. Only cell bodies of noradrenaline neurons were strongly fluorescent, whereas the nerve terminals and axons showed a weak or moderate fluorescence intensity. The fine noradrenaline nerve terminals in some areas, such as the thalamus, were invisible or, under favourable conditions, weakly fluorescent. Therefore, in the present study we are mainly dealing with the dopamine neurons of the upper brain stem. Our results demonstrate a widespread occurrence of TH-positive neuron systems in the mes- and diencephalon. The different mesencephalic dopamine systems and their ascending projections were visualized. Numerous TH-positive cell bodies were present along the ventricle system extending from the aqueductus cerebri to the most cranial periventricular parts of the third ventricle. The caudal part of these neurons, consisting of very small cell bodies, belong to the dorsal periventricular system described by Lindvall and Bj\u00f6rklund. Several TH-positive cell bodies were also observed in the inferior collicle of young animals. In the superficial layers of the inferior collicles TH positive nerve terminals were seen. At the hypothalamic level the A11 to A14 cell groups as well as some additonal cell bodies and extensive nerve terminal plexuses appeared strongly fluorescent. The differences in the intensity of the TH-related immunofluorescence between various brain regions and between various neuron systems may well reflect differences in enzyme levels between the various catacholamine systems rather than be due to the existence of different types of TH.", "pmid": "12423", "mesh_set": "D000320 D000818 D001369 D002395 D003712 D004027 D005455 D007031 D008297 D008636 D009411 D009474 D051381 D013788 D014446", "score": 44.134052, "rank": 87, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Electron microscopy of the plasma membrane and its subfractions showed that the H-membranes were very similar to the plasma membrane fraction, both contained junctional complexes, long membrane sheets, and vesicles. In contrast, the L-membranes consisted mainly of short membrane sheets and vesicles, and only a few junctional complexes. The H-membranes had greater adenylate cyclase activity which responded to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) while this hormone had very little effect on the enzyme activity in the L-membranes. Despite the marked difference in TSH stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in the H- and L-membrane fractions, specific binding of 125I-TSH was similar in both fractions. The L-membranes had higher specific activities of 5'-nucleotidase and Mg2+ATPase while (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase activities were similar in the two subfractions. Protein kinase activity of H-membranes was not significantly stimulated by exogenous cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Plasma membranes and H-membranes contained a substrate capable of being phosphorylated. Such phosphorylation was slightly increased by addition of soluble protein kinase. The phosphorylation of exogenous histone by protein kinase of plasma membranes and H-membranes was augmented by cAMP.

Similar results were obtained for terbutaline. Tazolol and H 80/62 (1-isopropylamino-3-(p-hydroxyphenoxy)-2-propanol (HCl), selective beta1-agonists, had no effect per se but inhibited the effect of terbutaline. Adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine all caused a dose-dependent decrease in the force of the soleus contractions, their potencies being in that order. Tyramine did not appreciably affect the contractions nor did it inhibit the effect of terbutaline. Pretreatment with reserpine, if anything, increased the response to terbutaline.

The lipid parameters in plasma and in postheparin plasma have been measured before and after 6 hours' incubation at 37degree C before and after specific treatment. In a limited number of cases the lecithin: cholesterol acyl transfer (LCAT) rate has been determined. In relapse, the PA cases showed increased free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations but decreased concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), unesterified cholesterol (UC) and all examined phospholipid fractions. After treatment, FFA remained unchanged and TG decreased, while TC and possibly also UC and the phospholipid frations were in line with reference levels. After incubations, UC and phosphatidylcholine (PC) decreased and lysolecithin (LL) increased. FFA increased and TG  decreased. Incubation of postheparin plasma resulted in an augmented decrease in TG and PC and increase in FFA and LL, In relapse, the changes on incubation were less pronounced than after treatment. The LCAT was low but within the normal range before treatment in the six cases examined. After treatment, LCAT rates increased but were still normal in relation to the plasma lipid concentrations. The study showed a decreased net esterification of cholesterol and LL formation on incubation of plasma in PA cases in relapse. This finding might be explained by the low concentration of plasma substrates for the LCAT reaction and phospholipases. After treatment the concentration of lipid substrates was restored to normal, with subsequent normal LL formation and cholesterol esterification. The observations could also explain the frequent lack of stabilization of erythrocytes suspended in plasma of PA after incubation, resulting in virtually the same ESR after as before this procedure. Due to low LL formation following the insufficient substrate availability for LCAT and phospholipase, the previously reported critical level of the LL concentration is not reached and cannot achieve its normal reduction of the ESR.", "pmid": "848351", "mesh_set": "D000752 D002784 D005230 D006493 D006801 D008055 D008244 D010713 D010743 D002785 D014280 D014805", "score": 17.864347, "rank": 3120, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

U.S.A. 73, 2574-2578) stimulated the incorporation of mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharides using a particulate enzyme fraction from maturing cotton bolls. This lipid fraction did not stimulate mannose incorporation into the mannosylphosphorylpolyprenol. The 14C-oligosaccharides, formed in the presence or absence of the pig liver \"acceptor\" lipid, were released from the lipid-linked oligosaccharides by mild acid hydrolysis and were isolated by paper chromatography. Both sets of 14C-oligosaccharides had similar mobilities suggesting that they were qualitatively similar, except that those formed in the presence of \"acceptor\" lipid had much more radioactivity. The individual oligosaccharides were purified on a calibrated column of Sephadex G-25 and were then subjected to various treatments to obtain information about their structures. The molecular weights of the larger oligosaccharides ranged from about L1210 to 1720 indicating they probably contained from 6 to 10 sugar residues. Strong acid hydrolysis of the oligosaccharide with a molecular weight of 1350, followed by reduction with NaB3H4, gave a ratio of [3H]hexitol to [3H]hexosaminitol that was compatible with the molecular weight (about 5:2). However, the hexitol fraction contained small amounts of [3H]glucitol in addition to [3H]mannitol. Thus, this oligosaccharide may contain small amounts of glucose in addition to mannose and GlcNAc. When the smaller oligosaccharides (i.e. those having 5 or 6 sugars) were treated with alpha-mannosidase, essentially of all the 14C was released as mannose, but only 30 to 50% of the radioactivity could be released from the larger oligosaccharides by this enzyme.

The effect on spleen colony formation caused by the transplantation of untreated lymphocytes, as well as of lymphocytes previously incubated with PHA, or with PHA plus L-asparaginase, or with lymphokines, was studied. Then the effect of the urinary colony-stimulating factor in vitro, and the in vitro feeder-layer activity of leucocytes on colony formation of human and mice bone marrow cells in haematological diseases is dealth with. The injection of rat lymphocytes previously incubated for 24 hours with PHA resulted in a higher number and a larger size of colonies in the spleen of the recipient rats. Lymphocytes preincubated with lymphokines gave rise to the formation of spleen colonies which were larger than those developing after the injection of untreated lymphocytes. When the lymphocytes were previously incubated with PHA plus L-asparaginase, PHA failed to stimulate colony formation in the spleen. The phenomenon is explained by assuming that PHA, as an aspecific stimulator of cell division, initiated the division of CFUs, thus the CFUs content of the preincubated samples increased, resulting in an increase in the number of colonies formed after the transplantation of lymphocytes pretreated with PHA. Another possible explanation is that CFUs division, or their spleen take is enhanced by the immunocompetent lymphocytes activated by PHA, either directly or via soluble mediators produced or released by immunocompetent lymphocytes such as lymphokines. The study of colony-forming cells and colony-stimulating activity in primary myelofibrosis (PM) showed an increase in the number of circulating CFUc in this condition, and an abnormal density of these cells reaching a peak below 1.062. The lowering of CSA in the first two peripheral blood gradient fractions agrees with the observation in the same fractions of a high percentage of CFUc at the expense of the CSC population.

The binding of glucose to hexokinase P-II, and the effect of this on the monomer--dimer association--dissociation reaction have been investigated quantitatively by a combination of titrations of intrinsic protein fluorescence and equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Association constants for the monomer-dimer reaction decreased with increasing pH, ionic strength and concentration of glucose. Saturating concentrations of glucose did not bring about complete dissociation of the enzyme showing that both sites were occupired in the dimer. At pH 8.0 and high ionic strength, where the enzyme existed as monomer, the dissociation constant of the enzyme-glucose complex was 3 X 10(-4) mol 1(-1) and was independent of the concentration of enzyme. Binding to the dimeric form at low pH and ionic strength (I=0.02 mol 1(-1), pH less than 7.5) was also independent of enzyme concentration (in the range 10-1000 mug ml-1) but was much weaker. The process could be described by a single dissociation constant, showing that the two available sites on the dimer were equivalent and non-cooperative; values of the intrinsic dissociation constant varied from 2.5 X 10(-3) mol 1(-1) at pH 7.0 to 6 X 10(-3) at pH 6.5. Under intermediate conditions (pH 7.0, ionic strength=0.15 mol 1(-1)), where monomer and dimer coexisted, the binding of glucose showed weak positive cooperatively (Hill coefficient 1.2); in addition, the binding was dependent upon the concentration of enzyme in the direction of stronger binding at lower concentrations. The results show that the phenomenon of half-sites reactivity observed in the binding of glucose to crystalline hexokinase P-II does not occur in solution; the simplest explanation of our finding the two sites to be equivalent is that the dimer results from the homologous association of two identical subunits.", "pmid": "8312", "mesh_set": "D001665 D005947 D006593 D006863 D007527 D007700 D046911 D008433 D011485 D012441 D013050 D014461", "score": 14.059224, "rank": 5049, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The increase in slope of diastolic depolarization behaved like the shift of the activation curve for the pacemaker potassium current towards positive potentials and the growth in plateau height like the increase in the slow inward current mainly carried by Ca ions. From this conformity we propose that the parameters evaluated by us from action potential records could be used for a qualitative analysis of the action of catecholamines on pacemaker potassium current and Ca influx.4 The effects of the isomers of a new drug, 1-isopropylamino-3(4'hydroxyphenoxy)-propan-2-ol (IHP), were evaluated in the same way as those of isoprenaline. The (-)-isomer was at optimal concentrations (10(-5) M) nearly half as effective as isoprenaline in increasing frequency and slope of diastolic depolarization but caused no increase in plateau height. An identical relationship, but at 5 to 10 times higher concentrations, was obtained with the (+)-isomer.5 When 10(-4) M(-)-IHP was added to a preparation equilibrated with a maximum dose of (-)-isoprenaline (10(-6) M), frequency and plateau height declined. This result together with the observation that the effects of IHP could be blocked by the specific beta-antagonist propranolol, revealed the beta-agonistic nature of the new drug. Its inefficiency in increasing the plateau height and thus the slow (Ca) inward current was explained by its relatively low potency and intrinsic activity.", "pmid": "27280", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000318 D000818 D002417 D004347 D005260 D006329 D066298 D007545 D011412 D011433 D011690", "score": 21.770302, "rank": 1674, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Reversible inhibition of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase by insulin.", "abstract": "Extracts of fasted rat diaphragms, previously treated with or without insulin were assayed for glycogen synthase, protein kinase and cyclic [3H]-AMP binding. Treatment with insulin produced an elevation in the % of glycogen synthase I and a concurrent decrease in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity and cyclic [3H]-AMP binding. Analysis of extracts by disc gel electrophoresis demonstrated the inhibition of cyclic [3H]-AMP binding to involve the Type I protein kinase holoenzyme. Inhibition of protein kinase activity was most apparent in the presence of 0.2 micrometer cyclic AMP, with enzymatic activity of the insulin-treated extracts typically 60--65% of control. Higher assay concentrations diminished the difference between control and insulin-treated extracts and concentrations greater than 20 micrometer abolished it. The inhibition of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity after insulin was a transient and labile phenomenon. The effect was independent of ATP concentration in the assay, but was sensitive to the pH of tissue extraction, requiring a pH of 7.0 to 8.4 to be observed. Insulin-mediated inhibition of protein kinase activity was reversed upon preincubation of extracts at 0--2 degrees. Relatively concentrated homogenates (less than 4 microliter buffer/mg tissue) yielded extracts which exhibited little or no inhibition of protein kinase activity compared to extracts prepared from more dilute (6--10 microliter/mg) homogenates. A model for the inhibition of the cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase by an insulin-generated inhibitor which becomes directly associated with the Type 1 holoenzyme is proposed.", "pmid": "25380", "mesh_set": "D000818 D000242 D003964 D004789 D006006 D006863 D007328 D008297 D047428 D051381", "score": 21.407536, "rank": 1785, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

HBF was unaltered despite decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. Cerebral hemispheric oxygen comsumption and carbon dioxide production decreased while cerebral hemispheric lactate production increased. Biphasic cerebral uptake of tyrosine was observed during and immediately after PBZ and PPL infusion. CSF HVA increased, indicating altered DA turnover.

Cerebral hemodynamic studies suggest a functional balance between monaminergic neurogenic influences in the control of cerebral circulation. Imbalance of such controlling factors in ischemic brain may lead to paradoxical vascular responses to induced hypertension and hypotension. PBZ and PPL enhance such responses perhaps by increasing central neurotransmitter turnover and release. Further shift toward cerebral anaerobic metabolism may occur in ischemic brain following the use of phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Worsening of neurological deficit occurred in four cases.

{"title": "Requirement of an essential thiol group and ferric iron for the activity of the progesterone-induced porcine uterine purple phosphatase.", "abstract": "The progesterone-induced purple phosphatase isolated from the uterine flushings of pigs is activated by a variety of reagents that cleave disulfide bonds, including 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, L-ascorbate, L-cysteine, sulfite, and cyanide. It is inhibited by various mercurials, iodoacetamide, O-iodosobenzoate, and hydrogen peroxide. Thiols increase the specific phosphatase activity from 25 to about 300 units per mg of enzyme. This activation is accompanied by a shift in the extinction maximum to higher energy to yield a protein with a pink coloration. Following maximum activation there is a gradual decrease in enzyme activity and protein color which is accompanied by loss of ferrous iron from the protein. Sodium dithionite at 10 mM or higher causes an immediate inhibition of phosphatase activity and bleaching of color, and can be used to prepare the iron-free apoprotein. The latter can be partially reactivated by Fe3+ salts but not by Fe2+. The Fe3+ restores the pink form of the enzyme with a specific activity of about 200 units/mg of protein. Cu2+ also causes some reactivation, but other metal ions were ineffective. ESR studies showed that the pink form of phosphatase contains approximately 1 atom of high spin ferric iron per molecule. It is concluded that the phosphatase requires a free thiol and Fe3+ for activity. Reduction of the iron leads to complete loss of both color and enzyme activity.

The lymph nodes of experimental animals did not exhibit a significantly greater number of Fc-RFL until day 6 with both tissue compartments peaking at day 10 and remaining significantly higher than controls until death. In neonatal BN animals significantly higher levels of Fc-RFL in experimental animals were not evident as early and peaked later (day 12) in both tissue compartments but again these differences remained until death.

The assay of Photosystem II activity through dichlorophenolindophenol photoreduction, oxygen evolution, fluorescence induction, shows that part of the centers is inactivated and that this part depends on the number of preilluminating flashes (maximum inhibition after one flash) in a way which suggests identification of state S2 as the target for alkaline inactivation. 2. As shown by Reimer and Trebst ((1975) Biochem. Physiol.

The electron flow through inactivated Photosystem II is restored by artificial donor addition (diphenylcarbazide or hydroxylamine); this suggests that the water-splitting enzyme itself is blocked.

Following the intravenous administration of maleate or maleic acid (50 mg/kg), mean fractional bicarbonate excretion (CHCO3/GFR) rose to as high as 26%. Na, K, and phosphate excretion also increased markedly, whereas C1 excretion remained low. An initial transient fall in urinary pH from 6.53 to 6.13 contrasted sharply with the rapid alkalinization of the urine induced by acetazolamide administration. During saline expansion CHCO3/GFR rose from 4 to 37% after maleate administration, whereas Cl excretion did not change significantly. During continuous carbonic anhydrase inhibition with acetazolamide, maleate administration resulted in a further rise in CHCO3/GFR from 22 to 35%. Whereas CPO4/GFR increased only from 1 to 3% during acetazolamide administration, this ratio reached 75% following the addition of maleate. Fumarate, the transisomer of maleate, and malonate, a well-known inhibitor of Krebs cycle, failed to affect bicarbonate excretion.

Fortimicin had relatively weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Fortimicin shows many of the characteristics of other aminoglycoside antibiotics: (i) improved activity at alkaline pH, (ii) rapid, bactericidal action, (iii) reduced activity with increasing inoculum levels, and (iv) synergistic activity with penicillin against enterococci. The activity of fortimicin was compared to that of gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against a group of 95 naturally occurring, antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas. The organisms were isolated from clinical sources and selected primarily for gentamicin resistance by the sensitivity disc test. Fortimicin showed excellent activity against this group of organisms.

The tested ergot alkaloids inhibit synaptosomal tyrosine hydroxylase activity and reverse the apomorphine-elicited inhibition of synaptosomal tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Thus, ergot alkaloids interact as both agonists and antagonists with the presynaptic DA receptors. Ergot alkaloids also compete effectively for the binding of 3H-DA and 3H-haloperidol to bovine striatal membranes. These results show that these drugs are mixed agonist-antagonists with respect to the postsynaptic DA receptors. To determine the effects of ergot alkaloids and of neuroleptics on the alpha-adrenergic receptors in the CNS, we have measured their effects on the binding of 3H-dihydroergocryptine and 3H-WB-4101 to cerebral cortical membranes. The displacing potencies of the tested ergot alkaloids and of the neuroleptics indicated that they have a high affinity for the alpha-adrenoreceptors in the CNS.

The superficial intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external solution (PDi) is negative with NaCl-Ringer's solution on both sides of the skin, displaying a minimum of -26.7+/-3.6 mV at 6+/-2 mum. Null value is obtained at 19+/-3 mum, with positive values for deeper impalements. Indications of cell impalements (abrupt voltage and resistance jumps) were frequently observed at sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface. Measurements of the electrical resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution, made with single- and double-barreled microelectrodes, showed great discrepancies, which may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the stratum corneum. PDi measured at a depth of 5 mum was a logarithmic function of Na2SO4 or K2SO4 concentration in the external solution, increasing in negativity with a reduction in concentration. Substitution of Na by K in the external solution had only minor effects on PDi. Acidification of the external solution from pH 9 is accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of PDi. At pH 3 PDi was positive. PDi was interpreted as a diffusion potential at the tip of the microelectrode due to KCl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the stratum corneum. Differences in K and Cl mobilities, responsible for the origin of PDi, were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the stratum corneum, with density and polarity determined by their degree of proponation, controlled by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution.

The combined studies provide a model from which a detailed profile of the effects of a hypnotic drug over short-, intermediate-, and long-term conditions can be thoroughly evaluated. Although sleep was significantly improved on the first night of flurazepam administration, peak effectiveness of the drug did not result until the second and third consecutive drug nights. Flurazepam continued to be effective in inducing and maintaining sleep with intermediate-and long-term drug use with only a slight loss of effectiveness with long-term use. Sleep was also significantly improved on the first and second nights of drug withdrawal. Carryover effectiveness of active metabolites of flurazepam from one drug night to the next drug night and to withdrawl nights is discussed. The clinical implications are discussed with regard to the time of peak effectiveness of the drug, dosage recommendations and schedule, minimizing possible effects of the drug on daytime performance, and the rationale and method for using drug holidays in the treatment regimen. With this comprehensive profile of the drug's actions, the physician is able to more rationally and effectively utilize the drug in treating the insomniac patient. With short-term administration, flurazepam produced a slight decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and an increase in REM latency. These effects were much more pronounced with intermediate-term drug administration, again possibly due to the accumulation of active metabolites. After withdrawal there was no rebound in REM sleep.

Initial uptake rates equalled essentially zero for high density serum lipoproteins and for large chylomicrons while administration of both low density serum lipoproteins and smaller chylomicrons produced a significant increase in hepatic cholesterol ester levels. The rate of uptake of both serum lipoprotein fractions did not change over a 5 h interval after injection: in contrast, the rates of uptake of the intestinal fractions increased 10-25-fold during this interval. Circulation of large chylomicrons in functionally eviscerated rats markedly increased the rate of hepatic cholesterol uptake when these metabolized lipoproteins were reinjected into recipient animals. Uptake of cholesterol from intestinal lipoproteins was essentially a linear function of the amount of chylomicrons administered to the animals and was independent of the level of circulating serum cholesterol and the rate of hepatic cholesterogenesis.

The gastric acid response to insulin hypoglycaemia in 3 DU patients was the same with intragastric water and alkaline buffer perfusion. The reduction of the gastric acid response to insulin hypoglycaemia by intragastric acidification corresponded to a reduced volume secretion and could not be ascribed to increased back diffusion of hydrogen ions or duodenal inhibition.

{"title": "A rabbit reticulocyte model for the role of hemin-controlled repressor in hypochromic anemias.", "abstract": "Hemin allows maximal protein synthesis in intact rabbit reticulocytes and their cell-free lysate preparations by retarding the formation of a translational repressor (HCR) found in the postribosomal supernate. In order to evaluate the role of HCR in the pathogenesis of hypochromic anemias, HCR was isolated and partially purified from intact rabbit reticulocytes incubated in vitro with either 0.1 mM alpha,alpha-dipyridyl (an iron-chelating agent) or 0.1 M ethanol. Both of these agents inhibit reticulocyte protein synthesis. Hemin (50 muM) protects against the inhibition by both agents. A ferrous iron-transferrin mixture, however, protects only against alpha,alpha-dipyridyl. Both alpha,alpha-dipyridyl and ethanol inhibit heme synthesis before the time that protein synthesis is affected, while neither lowers either ATP or GSH levels. These results indicate that while both agents inhibit heme synthesis, alpha,alpha-dipyridyl does so by inducing iron deficiency while ethanol works at a non-iron-requiring step. When HCR was isolated from intact cells and assayed in the reticulocyte cell-free systems, plus and minus hemin, premature appearance of HCR was found in cells incubated in vitro with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl or ethanol. When hemin was present in the intact cell incubation, the appearance of HCR was retarded. The HCR from alpha,alpha-dipyridyl ethanol-treated cells was partially purified and eluted at the same location on a Sephadex G-200 column (molecular weight approximately 3 x 10(5)) as that from postribosomal supernates incubated minus hemin. In addition rabbits with phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia were given intravenous ethanol in vivo at a dose of 0.4 ml/kg. This concentration of alcohol resulted in an inhibition of the rate of heme synthesis and protein synthesis as well as an acceleration of HCR formation in reticulocytes. The HCR from these in vivo treated rabbits was isolated, partially purified, and assayed in an identical fashion as the in vitro experiments. These in vivo experiments further support the physiological and pathophysiological role of HCR in reticulocytes. On the basis of these results a model for a role of HCR in some of the hypochromic anemias is proposed. In iron deficiency or chronic disease (where iron is not available to the erythroblast for heme synthesis) HCR appears prematurely and inhibits protein synthesis. When heme synthesis is inhibited by ethanol but there is sufficient intracellular iron, HCR appears prematurely and inhibits protein synthesis, iron accumulates in the erythroblast, and the end result is sideroblastic anemia.", "pmid": "2617", "mesh_set": "D015082 D000255 D000747 D000818 D002474 D002614 D004195 D000431 D005809 D005978 D006418 D006427 D007700 D014176 D012343 D011817 D012156", "score": 10.395226, "rank": 6022, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Evidence from 13C NMR for protonation of carbamyl-P and N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate in the active site of aspartate transcarbamylase.", "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance has been used to study the binding of [13C]carbamyl-P (90% enriched) to the catalytic subunit of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase. Upon forming a binary complex, there is a small change in the chemical shift of the carbonyl carbon resonance, 2 Hz upfield at pH 7.0, indicating that the environments of the carbonyl group in the active site and in water are similar. When succinate, an analog of L-aspartate, is added to form a ternary complex, there is a large downfield change in the chemical shift for carbamyl-P, consistent with interaction between the carbonyl group and a proton donor of the enzyme. The change might also be caused by a ring current froma nearby aromatic amino acid residue. From the pH dependence of this downfield change and from the effects of L-aspartate analogs other than succinate, the form of the enzyme involved is proposed to be an isomerized ternary complex, previously observed in temperature jump and proton NMR studies. The downfield change to chemical shift for carbamyl-P bound to the isomerized complex is 17.7 +/- 1.0 Hz. Using this value, the relative ability of other four-carbon dicarboxylic acids to form isomerized ternary complexes with the enzyme and carbamyl-P has been evaluated quantitatively. The 13C peak for the transition state analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), 90% enriched specifically at the amide carbonyl group, is shifted 20 Hz downfield of the peak for free PALA upon binding to the catalytic subunit at pH 7.0. In contrast, the peak for [1-13C] phosphonaceatmide shifts upfield by about 6 Hz upon binding. Since PALA induces isomerization of the enzyme and phosphonacetamide does not, these data provide further evidence consistent with protonation of the carbonyl group only upon isomerization. The degrees of protonation is strong acids of the carbonyl groups of PALA, phosphonacetamide and urethan (a model for the labile carbamyl-P) have been determined, as have the chemical shifts for these compounds upon full protonation. From these data it is calculated that the amide carbonyl groups of carbamyl-P and PALA might be protonated to a maximum of about 20% in the isomerized complexes at pH 7.0. The change in conformation of the enzyme-carbamyl-P complex upon binding L-aspartate, previously proposed to aid catalysis by compressing the two substrates together in the active site, may be accompanied by polarization of the C=O bond, making this ordinarily unreactive group a much better electrophile. A keto analog of PALA, 4,5-dicarboxy-2-ketopentyl phosphonate, also binds tightly to the catalytic subunit and induces a very similar conformational change, whereas an alcohol analog, 4,5-dicarboxy-2-hydroxypentyl phosphonate, does not bind tightly, indicating the critical importance of an unhindered carbonyl group with trigonal geometry.", "pmid": "9410", "mesh_set": "D001224 D001665 D002219 D002221 D004926 D006863 D007700 D009682 D063065 D011485 D013329", "score": 14.247227, "rank": 4969, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Sodium chloride at concentrations equivalent to or greater than 12 g/100 ml inhibited growth and aflatoxin production, while at 8 g or less/100 ml, growth and aflatoxin production were stimulated. At 2 g or less/100 ml, sodium acetate also stimulated growth and aflatoxin production, but reduction occurred with 4 g or more/100 ml. Malonic acid at 10, 20, 40, and 50 mM reduced growth and aflatoxin production (over 50%) while sodium malonate at similar concentrations but different pH values had the opposite effect. Benzoic acid (pH 3.9) and sodium benzoate (pH 5.0) at 0.4 g/100 ml completely inhibited growth and aflatoxin production. Examination of the effect of initial pH indicated that the extent of inhibitory action of malonic acid and sodium acetate was a function of initial pH. The inhibitory action of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate appeared to be a function of undissociated benzoic acid molecules. Aflatoxin reduction was usually accompanied by an unidentified orange pigment, while aflatoxin stimulation was accompanied by unidentified blue and green fluorescent spots but with lower Rf values that aflatoxins B1, G1, B2, and G2 standards.", "pmid": "19682", "mesh_set": "D000085 D000348 D001231 D001565 D006863 D008314 D010860 D012965", "score": 19.571749, "rank": 2407, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Pretreatment with the histamine H2-receptor antagonist metiamide (100 and 200 mug i.c.v.) failed to modify either of the responses. A dose-related antagonism of the hypertensive response to histamine i.c.v. was elicited by phentolamine (100 and 200 mug i.c.v.) but the positive chronotropic effect was not modified by this pretreatment. The cardiovascular responses to histamine i.c.v. were abolished by mecamylamine (5.0 mg/kg i.v.) and greatly reduced by 6-hydroxydopamine (3 X 250 mug i.c.v.), but only the tachycardia was significantly modified by atropine (100 mug i.c.v.) and propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.).

In order to further characterize this binding activity, we have investigated its homologue in rat liver. After being transported to the liver by the serum protein transcobalamin II, [57Co]Cbl was bound by at least two distinct proteins, one cytosolic, the other mitochondrial. Labeled Cbl bound to cytosolic protein faster than or prior to the mitochondrial protein. With time there was a decline in radioactivity associated with the cytosolic binder and a coordinate increase in that associated with the mitochondrial binder. Although both proteins cochromatographed on Sephadex G-150 and had apparent molecular weights of 120,000, they were separated into two discrete components by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The cytosolic binder cochromatographed with N5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase activity (5-methyltetrahydropteroyl-L-glutamate:L-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.13); the mitochondrial one with methylmalonyl CoA mutase activity (methylmalonyl-CoA CoA-carbonylmutase, EC 5.4.99.2). These proteins were distinguished further by the chemical forms of [57Co]Cbl found with them, hydroxocobalamin and methylcobalamin with the cytosolic protein and adenosylcobalamin with the mitochondrial one. These results suggest that intracellular Cbl binding activity in rat liver can be accounted for by attachment of Cbl to the two known Cbl-dependent apoenzymes, methylmalonyl CoA mutase and methyltetrahydrofolate methyltransferase.

Catecholamine synthesis was estimated by measuring the accumulation of 3H-dopamine and 3H-norepinephrine formed from an injection of 3H-tyrosine. Morphine produced dose-related increases in both tail-flick activity and catecholamine synthesis. Each of the narcotic analgesics produced a significant increase in catecholamine synthesis 30 minutes after the subcutaneous injection of an antinociceptive dose (ED80). Under these same conditions, drugs which are inactive in the tail-flick test, such as pentazocine, produced a decrease in catecholamine synthesis and cyclazocine; naloxone and naltrexone were without significant effect. However, cyclazocine, which was inactive in the tail-flick test and did not alter catecholamine synthesis 30 minutes after administration, demonstrated tail-flick activity and produced increased catecholamine synthesis 2 minutes after its administration. Morphine was devoid of either activity 2 minutes after administration. Similarly, at 2 hours after the administration of a dose of morphine (10 mg/kg) that was active in the tail-flick test and increased catecholamine synthesis at 30 minutes, neither tail-flick activity nor increased catecholamine synthesis was observed. Naloxone blocked both the antinociceptive action and the increased catecholamine synthesis produced by both morphine and methadone. The results of these studies indicate that a correlation exists between tail-flick activity of narcotic-like drugs and their ability to increase catecholamine synthesis.

The ability of neonatal guinea pigs to manifest cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) responses was examined. Neonates were competent to express macroscopic and microscopic aspects of these delayed reactions. Strong cutaneous basophil responses were elicited in newborns (0 to 2 days old) in a hapten-specific manner after intravenous transfer of small amounts of immune serum (0.5 ml) obtained from adult donors. Also, neonatal guinea pigs actively immunized at birth with hapten-carrier conjugates emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and skin tested when 1 week old had 24-hr hapten-specific cutaneous basophil reactions and CBH reactions to the carrier protein as well. Compared with adult CBH reactions, neonatal responses had equal concentrations of basophils, fewer monocuclear cells, less macroscopic erythema, and almost no induration. Hapten-specific CBH reactions also contained significant infiltrates of eosinophils which were more prominent in the ear skin vs flank skin and in neonates vs adults. Immunization with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) resulted in a marked difference between adults and neonates; adult PPD reactions were quite indurated and contained many more monoculear cells and few basophils, whereas neonatal PPD reactions were flat, erythematous, nonindurated, and contained relatively few mononuclear cells and more basophils. Thus, neonatal tuberculin reactions elicited by PPD in animals immunized with CFA were examples of CBH. Skin testing nonimmune guinea pigs with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) also revealed marked differences in 24-hr cutaneous reactions between adults and newborns. Adults had indurated and erythematous reactions which contained approximately 20% basophils and 80% mononuclear cells, whereas similar PHA skin tests in newborns elicited small macroscopic reactions, which microscopically showed large infiltrates containing approximately 80% basophils and 20% mononuclear cells. It was concluded that neonatal guinea pigs were not only competent to manifest basophil-containig delayed-type reactions, but that cutaneous basophil responses were preferentially elicited in these animals under a variety of circumstances. These results underline the fact that basophil accumulations are one aspect of delayed skin test responses and that the regulation of the arrival of these cells in neonates is different from that in adult guinea pigs.", "pmid": "845431", "mesh_set": "D000818 D000831 D000941 D001491 D005620 D006168 D006968 D007110 D037102 D010047 D012882", "score": 7.5317755, "rank": 6125, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Kinetics of the purified enzyme and the effects of antibodies elicited against it on membrane-bound and free enzyme.", "abstract": "The purified respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli oxidizes NADH with either dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP). ferricyanide, or menadione as electron acceptors, with values for NADH are similar with the three electron acceptors (approximately 50 muM). The purified enzyme contains no flavin and has an absolute requirement for FAD, with Km values around 4 muM. The pH optimum of the enzyme appears to be between 6.5 and 7; the optimum is difficult to establish because of nonenzymatic reduction of DCIP at the lower pH values. Potassium cyanide stimulates the DCIP reductase activity about 2-fold, but has no effect on ferricyanide reductase. The enzyme exhibits hyperbolic kinetics with respect to NADH concentration in both the ferricyanide and DCIP reductase assays, but cooperatively is seen in the menadione reductase reaction. NAD+ is an effective competitive inhibitor of the reaction (Ki congruent to 20 muM); in the presence of NAD+, the NADH saturation curve becomes cooperative, even in the DCIP reductase assay. Many adenine containing nucleotides are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. The apparent Ki values for these nucleotides as inhibitors of the purified enzyme, the membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenase, and the NADH oxidase are equivalent. An examination of inhibitory effects of a series of adenine nucleotides suggests that the inhibitors act as analogues of NAD+, which is the true physiological inhibitor. The results suggest that the enzyme in situ is always partially inhibited by the levels of NAD- in the E coli cell, and thus behaves in a cooperative fashion to changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio. An antibody has been elicited against the purified NADH dehydrogenase. Immunodiffusion and crossed immunoelectrophoresis show that the antibody is directed principally against the NADH dehydrogenase, with some activity against minor contaminants in the purified preparation.

Hydrolysis of peptides, and inactivation of angiotensin and bradykinin by cathepsin A.", "abstract": "Systematic analysis of the hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-dipeptides by cathepsin A [EC 3.4.12.1] purified from rat liver lysosomes showed that multiple forms of cathepsin A preferentially cleave peptide bonds with leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine. Cbz-Met-Met, -Met-Phe, -Phe-Met, and -Phe-Ala were hydrolyzed 6 to 8 times faster than the standard substrates, Cbz-Glu-Phe and Cbz-Glu-Tyr. The pH optima of the hydrolyses were 4.6 to 5.8. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds with glycine, isoleucine, and proline was very slow, but the rate depended on the nature of the adjacent amino acids. Proteins such as albumin, cytochrome c, gamma-globulin, hemoglobin, histone, myoglobin, and myosin were scarecely degraded. Peptide hormones, such as glucagon and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were hydrolyzed markedly with optimum pH's of 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. Angiotensin I, II, bradykinin, Lys- and Met-Lysbradykinin (kallidin and Met-kallidin), and substance P were also hydrolyzed at appreciable rates. pH optima for these peptide hormones were 5.2 to 5.6. On the other hand, insulin and its A chain, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), oxytocin and vasopressin were cleaved slowly. In the hydrolyses of glucagon and other peptides, multiple forms of rat liver lysosomal cathepsin A again showed a carboxypeptidase nature, cleaving peptide bonds sequentially from the carboxyl terminal. Almost all of the amino acids were cleaved on prolonged incubation. Vaso-activites of angiotensin II and bradykinin were rapidly lost on hydrolysis by cathepsin A. Lysosomal cathepsin C [dipeptidylaminopeptidase I, EC 3.4.14.1] also activated angiotensin II, but did not inactive bradykinin. Cathepsin A, therefore, can be regarded as one of the lysosomal angiotensinases and kinases.

The concentration of physostigmine required to produce the maximum increase in sensitivity to acetylcholine almost completely inhibited the cholinesterase in muscle homogenates. This concentration of physostigmine had no effect on muscle contractures elicited by carbachol. By taking account of the combined effects of acetylcholine diffusion and enzymic hydrolysis, a quantitative theoretical relationship has been derived between the level of cholinesterase activity in cylindrical muscles and the fractional occupancy of the acetylcholine receptors in these muscles in the presence of different concentrations of exogenous acetylcholine. This theory attributes the thousand-fold increase in sensitivity to exogenous acetylcholine produced by anticholinesterases in chick biventer cervicis muscles largely to an alteration in acetylcholine concentration gradient within the muscle and accounts satisfactorily for the shift in the dose-response curve for acetylcholine which occurs after treatment of the muscles with various concentrations of physostigmine.", "pmid": "27608", "mesh_set": "D000109 D000818 D002217 D002645 D002800 D066298 D007700 D009119 D009132 D010830", "score": 16.4467, "rank": 3857, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Length-dependent activation: its effect on the length-tension relation in cat ventricular muscle.", "abstract": "In cat papillary muscles at 30 degrees C, bathed with Tyrode's solution containing 2.25 mM Ca2+, the effect of various inotropic interventions (varying the stimulus frequency and continual paired stimulation) on the shape of the steady state length-tension relation was examined at lengths from Lmax, where tension production is maximal, to 0.87 Lmax. The relative steepness of the length-tension curves for peak tension developed (DT) and for maximum rate of tension development (dT/dT) varied inversely with the degree of potentiation. Thus, during paired pulse stimulation the relative decline in DT and dT/dT for a given change in muscle length was significantly less than the decline observed during stimulation at 5 min-1. When a muscle was stretched DT did not reach its final steady level for several minutes, and this slow increase in DT contributed significantly to the steepness of the steady state length-tension relation. The half-time of the slow increase in DT exhibited beat-dependency, and conditions that reduce the transsarcolemmal influx of calcium (reduction in bathing [Ca2+] or the presence of verapamil) significantly prolonged the time course of the slow increase and reduced its magnitude. These results support the hypothesis (1) that there is length-dependence of the excitation-contraction coupling process, such that an increase in muscle length is accompanied by greater activation of the contractile system; and (2) that this is due at least in part to an increased influx of calcium into the muscle cells. The implication of this hypothesis is that the influence of muscle length on myocardial performance (the Frank-Starling relation) should not be regarded as fundamentally different in character from other inotropic interventions.", "pmid": "837472", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002118 D002415 D046508 D004305 D006321 D008564 D009200 D009206 D010210 D012508 D013718 D016276 D014700", "score": 17.716663, "rank": 3198, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP by intact chloroplasts under flash illumination and in darkness.", "abstract": "ATP concentrations were measured in isolated intact spinach chloroplasts under various light and dark conditions. The following results were obtained: (1) Even in darkened chloroplasts and in the absence of exogenous substrates, ATP levels in the chloroplast stroma were significant. They decreased on addition of glycerate, phosphoglycerate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate. When dihydroxyacetone phosphate and oxaloacetate were added together, ATP levels increased in darkened chloroplasts owing to substrate level phosphorylation. (2) Under illumination with saturating single turnover flashes, oxygen evolution in the presence of phosphoglycerate, whose reduction requires ATP, was no lower on a unit flash basis at the low flash frequency of 2 Hz than at higher frequencies. Quenching of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence, which indicates the formation of a proton gradient in intact chloroplasts, decreased with decreasing flash frequencies, until there was no significant fluorescence quenching at a flash frequency of about 2 Hz. In contrast to intact chloroplasts, broken chloroplasts did not phosphorylate much ADP at the low flash frequency of 2 Hz. (3) Flashing at extremely low frequencies (0.2 Hz) caused ATP hydrolysis rather than ATP synthesis in intact chloroplasts. At higher flash frequencies, synthesis replaced hydrolysis. Still, even at high frequencies (10 Hz), the first flashes of a series of flashes given after a long dark time always decreased chloroplast ATP levels. From these results, it is concluded that the enzyme, which mediates ATP synthesis in the light, is inactive in darkened intact chloroplasts. Its light activation can be separated from the formation of the high energy condition, which results in ATP synthesis. After its activation, the enzyme catalyzes a reversible reaction.", "pmid": "30476", "mesh_set": "D000244 D000255 D002736 D003624 D006863 D007700 D008027 D010100 D010944 D006180 D013816", "score": 16.856112, "rank": 3650, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

At low enzyme concentration, a large fraction of the particle material accumulated at 35-45 S. The accumulation was more marked for proteins in the 30000-38000 molecular weight range. Heterogeneous complexes containing a large spectrum of proteins with a characteristic distribution were disclosed between 60 and 200 S. At high ribonuclease concentration the total quantity of proteins at 35-45 S decreased, but the proteins of 30000-38000 molecular weight predominated. Heterogeneous complexes were also present. Finally at very high enzyme concentration, the particles were almost entirely hydrolyzed. Only a small amount of heterogeneous complexes subsisted at 30-190 S. The RNA content of the remaining ribonucleoprotein complexes as well as its size decreased upon ribonuclease treatment as shown by CsCl density determination and electrophoretic analysis. The results suggested that the stability of the complexes depended upon protein-protein as well as RNA-protein interactions. They also showed that sequences up to 200-300 nucleotides were protected by proteins against ribonuclease. The results were compatible with the existence of at least 3 constituents in the particles. The previously defined monoparticle population accumulating at 35-45 S was heterogeneous in respect to ribonuclease sensitivity and protein composition. The 30000-38000 molecular weight proteins accumulating at low ribonuclease and predominating afterwards were assumed to belong to monoparticles alpha. Monoparticles beta contained a larger range of proteins more easily released by the enzymes. The heterogeneous complexes were a third constituent whose relationship with the monoparticles war not established yet. A large fraction of the particle phosphoproteins was associated to these complexes. On the basis of our experiments in vitro it is assumed that monoparticle alpha can be preferentially isolated from the nuclei under conditions where endogeneous ribonuclease is high and (or) not inhibited.

{"title": "3-Nitropropionate, the toxic substance of Indigofera, is a suicide inactivator of succinate dehydrogenase.", "abstract": "We have shown that 3-nitropropionate, an isoelectronic analogue of succinate, is a suicide inactivator of succinate dehydrogenase [succinate:(acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC 1.3.99.1] as follows. (i) When rat liver mitochondria oxidize succinate in the presence of 3-nitropropionate carbanion, the rate of O(2) consumption decreases exponentially to a zero value. This pattern is duplicated by subsequent additions of mitochondria. The dependence of the apparent first-order rate constant for enzyme inhibition, as well as the number of enzyme turnovers completed before inhibition, on the concentrations of 3-nitropropionate carbanion and succinate are those expected for an active site-directed and irreversible inhibitor. (ii) The inactivated enzyme is not resuscitated by centrifugation and washing of the mitochondria, in contrast to malonate-treated enzyme, and malonate protects against irreversible, inhibition. (iii) The inhibitor species is 3-nitropropionate carbanion and no external nucleophile is required for inhibition. (iv) The respiratory rates, respiratory control ratios, and ADP/O ratios obtained with NAD-linked substrates are unaffected by 3-nitropropionate carbanion. These results show that 3-nitropropionate carbanion is a highly specific, time-dependent, and irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. By analogy with the reaction of nitroethane with D-amino acid oxidase, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the carbanionic inhibitor forms a covalent N-5 adduct with the active site flavin. However, the precise mechanism of inactivation, as well as mechanistic extrapolations to the oxidation of succinate, must await the elucidation of the structure of the modified enzyme. We can now explain the toxicity of plants such as Indigofera endecaphylla for mammals and fowl as being due to the irreversible blockage of the Krebs cycle by 3-nitropropionate carbanion.", "pmid": "269430", "mesh_set": "D000818 D007700 D008297 D008930 D009574 D010101 D010944 D011422 D051381 D013385", "score": 18.843012, "rank": 2697, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The uptake of 42K by these Na-loaded tissues was followed for 10 min in the presence and absence of 1-37 X 10(-4) M ouabain, this being sufficient to inhibit Na pumping maximally. Subtraction of the uptake seen in the presence from that seen in the absence of ouabain gave estimates of the pumped ouabain-sensitive K uptake. 2. In Na-free (MgCl2) medium this depended on the [K]0 in a sigmoidal fashion with a half maximal [K]0 for activation of some 4mM. The maximal uptake of K was 3 m-mole/kg.min corresponding to a transmembrane flux of some 12-5 p-mole. cm-2.sec-1. 3. In the presence of Na the K activation curve became more obviously sigmoid and higher concentrations of K were needed to achieve a given active K influx. The results were well fitted by assuming that Na and K competed for two identical, non-interacting sites on the external pump face. 4. Addition of K during the efflux of 24Na into a Na-free (MgCl2) medium led to an increased rate of tracer loss. The magnitude of this increase depended on the [K] used in a hyperbolic fashion and it was abolished by addition of ouabain. The [K] causing half-maximal activation of ouabain-sensitive Na efflux was in the order of 1-2 mM. 5. When the [K] in the uptake media was 1-5 mM; Na, Li, Rb and Cs all inhibited ouabain-sensitive K uptake, the order of effectiveness being Rb greater than Cs greater than Na greater than Li.

{"title": "Stereoselective and calcium-dependent contractile effects of narcotic antagonist analgesics in the vascular smooth muscle of the rat.", "abstract": "In patients, pentazocine administered i.v. can have an unusual action for a strong analgesic-an elevation of blood pressure. The objective of this study in rats was to better quantify and explain the molecular mechanism for the vascular action of l-pentazocine and compare it with other analgesics and narcotic antagonists. In anesthetized rats, l-pentazocine (0.3-3 mg/kg i.v.) elevated blood pressure and this effect was potentiated in pithed rats. The contraction appeared to be nonadrenergic as it was not blocked by the alpha blocker, phenoxybenzamine. In vitro, morphine (ED50 = 4 X 10(-5) M) and the l-isomers of pentazocine (ED50 = 8 X 10(-6) M) contracted the spirally cut aortic strip. The l-isomers were approximately 5 times more potent than their d-enantiomers. Contraction of the aorta by l-pentazocine was not inhibited by dibenamine, atropine, diphenhydramine, pyrilamine or indomethacin nor potentiated by propranolol. On the other hand, not only was the contraction highly dependent on the concentration of calcium in the bath but it was also blocked by verapamil and SKF-525A, drugs known to inhibit transmembrane calcium influx. Naloxone (3 X 10(-4) to 1 X 10(-3) M), which produced no contractile effect by itself, reduced aortic contraction of l-pentazocine to the greatest extent, that of potassium moderately and that of norepinephrine only slightly. The naloxone blockade of l-pentazocine vascular contraction was reversed by increasing Ca++ concentration in the media, suggesting the action of naloxone may resemble a calcium blocker. It is proposed that a direct, stereoselective and calcium dependent vascular action of l-pentazocine contributes to its ability to raise blood pressure. The possibility that in high doses narcotic antagonists may decrease calcium influx should  also be considered.", "pmid": "7664", "mesh_set": "D000701 D000818 D001013 D001794 D002118 D066298 D008297 D009119 D009130 D009292 D010423 D010643 D051381 D011941 D013116 D013237", "score": 20.616875, "rank": 2027, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The Ki for phenylglyoxal was 6.7mM and Ks for competition with NADPH was 0.5mM. Complete inactivation of glutamate dehydrogenase by butane-2,3-dione was estimated by extrapolation to result from the loss of 3 of the 19 arginine residues/subunit. NADPH, but not NADH, provided almost complete protection against inactivation. Butane-2,3-dione had only a slight inactivating effect on glutamate synthase. The data suggest that an essential arginine residue may be involved in the binding of NADPH to glutamate dehydrogenase.

The pH vs. uptake profile exhibits a maximum near pH 8.2 in H2O medium. When the medium was changed to 2H2O, the profile showed a shift of maximum corresponding to the pKa change of the phenolic OH group. The pH vs. uptake profile of tyramine was quite different from that of norepinephrine. These pH effects on uptake were explained as manifestations of the involvement of the phenolic OH group in the process. The amine and phenolic hydroxyl groups in norepinephrine were studied separately by employing two series of compounds structurally related to catecholamines, amphetamine-like and catechol-like, for their inhibitory effects on the uptake. The inhibitions were affected by changes in pH with changes in opposite directions found for the two series indicating the need for a positive charge in the side chain and suggesting an effect of the negative charge on the ring.

Upon addition of a nitrogen source to such cells, the development of the enzyme begins within 12 h, along with the resumption of growth and net protein synthesis. Derepression occurs in cells growing on the slowly assimilated nitrogen in urea, reaching specific activities very similar to those which develop in cells grown on nitrate, in spite of the lower protein accumulation rate on urea. Thus the ATP sulfurylase of tobacco cells appears to be regulated by both a negative feedback mechanism in which an end product of the sulfate assimilation pathway is the effector, and by a positive mechanism which serves to couple the regulation of the sulfate assimilation pathway to the cells' potential for nitrogen assimilation, i.e. net protein synthesis. The sulfur compounds which affect the development of ATP sulfurylase in vivo have no effect on the enzyme activity in vitro. Furthermore, extracts with high activity contain no activator and extracts with low activity contain no inhibitor of ATP sulfurylase. Cycloheximide, at a concentration which strongly inhibits amino acid incorporation into protein, inhibits derepression. ATP sulfurylase does not decay in cells inhibited by cycloheximide. Therefore, the changes in ATP sulfurylase of tobacco cells appear to involve changes in the rate of formation or degradation of the enzyme.", "pmid": "845148", "mesh_set": "D000255 D000596 D002478 D003513 D003545 D004794 D005978 D007700 D008715 D009713 D010944 D010947 D013431 D013438 D014026 D014508", "score": 17.19617, "rank": 3458, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

A filtering bleb develops, if the transconjunctival route and the diffuse resorption is predominent. Newly incorporated veins and lymphatic vessels enable the drainage of the aqueous humour without a visible bleb. Most important for the formation of these vessels is the surgical technique. Therefore it is not only necessary to cover the fistula with a scleral flap but also to gain a physiological intraocular pressure immediately after the operation. If the tension is too low in most cases a filtering bleb will form. If it is at a physiological level (i.c. above the episcleral vein pressure) new vessels can develop and drain the aqueous humour by bulkflow from the scleral fistula and that means a good pressure regulating effect without a filtering bleb.", "pmid": "850340", "mesh_set": "D001082 D003228 D005123 D005452 D005901 D006801 D007429 D007700 D008208 D014129 D014680", "score": 17.926605, "rank": 3082, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Gastric acid responses to the test meals were measured in the Heidenhain pouch, gastric and pancreatic fistula dogs, using the intragastric titration method, and monitoring the rate at which a solution of 1-0 N-NaOH had to be added to maintain the pH of the gastric content constant at pre-selected values ranging from 5-0 to 1-0. In this way the pH profile of the gastric acid and pepsin responses to a liver extract meal kept in the Heidenhain pouch or gastric fistula as well as to exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine could be determined. 2. A liver extract meal adjusted to pH 5-0 produced a potent and pressure-related stimulation of acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch without any change in secretion from the main stomach and pancreas or in the serum concentration of immuno-assayable gastrin. 3. Graded decrease of the liver extract meal pH to below 5-0 resulted in the pH-dependent inhibition of gastric acid output, which at pH 1-0 was only about 30% of the value attained at pH 5-0. Acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch induced by exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine also showed gradual decrease when the pH of the pouch content was decreased in sequential order from 5-0 to 1-0. This pH-dependent inhibition was accompanied by an increase in pepsin secretion. 4. The pH-dependent inhibition of the Heidenhain pouch response to the liver extract meal was not altered by topical application of a local anaesthetic and atropine or by the intravenous infusion of large doses of atropine, secretin or metiamide, which were shown to cause a marked inhibition of the main stomach response to the liver meal. 5.

The preparation comprises a thin strip of lung parenchyma which can be mounted in a conventional organ bath for isometric tension recording. Its pharmacological responses have been characterized and compared with the isolated tracheal preparation of the cat. 2 The lung strip exhibited an intrinsic tone which was relaxed by catecholamines, aminophylline and flufenamate. It was contracted strongly by histamine, prostaglandin F2alpha, acetylcholine, compound 48/80, potassium depolarizing solution and alternating current field stimulation. In contrast, the cat trachea was unresponsive to histamine and prostaglandin F2alpha and did not exhibit an intrinsic tone. 3 (-)-Isoprenaline and (-)-adrenaline were much more potent in relaxing the lung strip than the trachea. The potency order of relaxation responses to isoprenaline, adrenaline and (+/-)-noradrenaline in the lung strip was isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline but in the trachea was isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than or equal to adrenaline. 4 beta2-Adrenoceptor selective agonists salbutamol and terbutaline were more potent in the lung strip than the trachea, suggesting beta2-adrenoceptors predominated in the lung strip. Propranolol was equipotent in inhibiting isoprenaline relexations of the lung strip and trachea, whereas practolol was much less effective in inhibiting lung strip than trachea, further supporting a predominance of beta2-adrenoceptors in lung strip and beta1-adrenoceptors in trachea. 5 Strong Schultz-Dale type contractions were elicited in both lung strips and trachea by Ascaris lumbricoides antigen in actively sensitized cats.

{"title": "Rat liver glutathione: possible role as a reservoir of cysteine.", "abstract": "Rat liver contains a high concentration (7-8mM) of reduced glutathione and its level changes rapidly when starving or feeding rats. We concluded that one of the functions of liver glutathione was to act as a reservoir of cysteine. When starved rats were fed a protein-free diet, the increase in liver glutathione was dependent on the amount of cysteine added to the diet. A cysteine-dependent increase of glutathione was also observed in rats fed a diet containing gelatin with cysteine, but the increase was relatively lowered compared with rats fed a protein-free diet containing the same amount of cysteine. This suppression of the increase in glutathione was observed much more clearly when the gelatin diet was fortified with tryptophan in addition to cysteine. In the presence of tryptophan, L-[35S]-cysteine in the diet appeared to be incorporated primarily into liver and serum proteins, and degradation of liver glutathione must also have been enhanced. Addition of excess cysteine to the diet masked the effects of gelatin and tryptophan, stimulated glutathione synthesis in the liver as well as incorporation of dietary cysteine into protein fractions. Prolonged starvation of rats or injection of dibutyryl-3',5'-cyclic AMP lowered the glutathione level,but the level did not decrease below 2 to 3 mM. These findings suggest that there may be at least two pools of glutathione.

The activities of leucine arylamidase (EC 3.4.1.1) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.2) as well as the concentrations of total and free cholesterol did not differ in the LP-X positive and negative infants. Except in one case, LP-X was never detectable on the first day of life. The earliest date of appearance was the second day. In the serum of some infants, who were LP-X positive shortly after birth, the lipoprotein could still be found at the age of 2--3 months. The incidence of LP-X was not higher in newborns with blood group incompatibility than in newborns with unspecific hyperbilirubinaemia. After exchange transfusions LP-X disappeared in most cases, but it could later often be detected again. In some newborns, who were LP-X negative a few days after birth LP-X was first detected at the age of 2-3 months. The LP-X test is of no use for th diagnosis of cholestasis in newborn infants. The test is specific for cholestasis only after the first year of life. The increased incidence of positive LP-X tests in newborns is discussed as a consequence of immature liver function.", "pmid": "5573", "mesh_set": "D001663 D001787 D002779 D002784 D005078 D006801 D007223 D007231 D007234 D007567 D007931 D008077 D008099 D005723", "score": 11.394281, "rank": 5886, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Differential effect of hypophysectomy on the synthesis of beta-glucuronidase and other androgen-inducible enzymes in mouse kidney.", "abstract": "The levels of several androgen responsive enzymes including beta-glucuronidase, alcohol dehydrogenase, D-amino acid oxidase and arginase, were compared in kidneys of normal and hypophysectomized female mice after treatment with testosterone. While hypophysectomy did not alter the basal level of glucuronidase, the androgen-mediated accumulation of kidney beta-glucuronidase was greatly decreased in hypophysectomized mice. Measurements of the rate of synthesis of glucuronidase showed that after androgen treatment the enzyme was synthesized in kidney of hypophysectomized mice at only 5% the normal rate. Glucuronidase activity in seven other organs was not appreciably affected by treatment with androgens or by hypophysectomy. Unlike the effect of hypophysectomy on kidney glucuronidase, there was no reduction in the accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase or D-amino acid oxidase in kidney of hypophysectomized mice after androgen treatment. Hypophysectomy caused a large reduction in kidney arginase activity. However, subsequent administration of testosterone restored much of this activity. It is concluded that there are at least two mechanisms by which androgens increase enzyme activity in kidney. The normal increase in activity or rate of synthesis of beta-glucuronidase following androgen administration requires pituitary hormones and/or products of these hormones, while the increase in activity of enzymes like alcohol dehydrogenase and D-amino acid oxidase does not require pituitary hormones.", "pmid": "12933", "mesh_set": "D000315 D000429 D000818 D001119 D001835 D002369 D003605 D004790 D005260 D005966 D007016 D007668 D007700 D051379 D008813 D009929 D009928 D013739", "score": 20.882113, "rank": 1944, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

[(3)H]ATP, [(3)H]ADP and [(3)H]AMP are taken up by these organelles by the same temperature-dependent mechanism. The apparent K(m) for ATP and ADP is 1.4mm, and for AMP it is 2.9mm. The uptake of ATP has a flat pH optimum, whereas the catecholamine uptake increases with more alkaline pH. Atractyloside and carboxyatractyloside are competitive and specific inhibitors of nucleotide uptake, whereas reserpine inhibits only that for catecholamines. Mg(2+) ions activate uptake of both catecholamine and nucleotides, whereas EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide inhibit these processes. Nucleotide and catecholamine uptakes are inhibited by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and by two ATP analogues. NH(4) (+) ions and nigericin in the presence of KCl inhibit only catecholamine uptake. It is concluded that nucleotide uptake, as proposed previously for catecholamine uptake, depends on an electrochemical proton gradient produced by a proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase localized in the membrane of chromaffin granules. Furthermore, as suggested by the effect of NH(4) (+) and nigericin, catecholamine uptake apparently depends on the chemical part of this gradient, whereas the results for nucleotide uptake are consistent with its dependence on the electrical component.", "pmid": "28725", "mesh_set": "D000244 D000249 D000255 D000313 D000818 D002417 D002837 D002838 D006863 D066298 D009638", "score": 11.823935, "rank": 5805, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Structure of single-stranded virus RNA in situ. II. Optical activity of five tobacco mosaic-like viruses and their components.", "abstract": "ORD and CD spectra of some TM-like viruses and their coat proteins were measured to study a possible role of tryptophan residues in RNA-protein interactions in these viruses. Five viruses of this group, differing in tryptophan content of their coat proteins, were used: v-TM virus (3 tryptophan residues per protein subunit), strains HR and U2 (2 tryptophan residues per subunit), dolihos enation mosaic virus and cucumber virus 4(1 tryptophan residue per subunit). The viruses differ significantly in their ORD and CD spectra and some correlation between these spectra and tryptophan content of coat proteins seems to exist. But an analysis of \"intravirus RNA\" CD spectra, obtained by subtraction of CD spectra of virus -like protein assemblies from the spectra of intact viruses, shows that the observed differences in optical activity can hardly be explained by tryptophan participation in RNA-protein interactions. The presence of the \"additional\" peak at 293 nm in the ORD of TM virus had been considered as evidence of tryptophan-RNA interactions in this virus. In the present work such a peak at 293 nm was observed in the ORD of all the 5 viruses studied, irrespective of the tryptophan content in their coat proteins. Besides, we managed to obtain the virus-like protein assemblies preparations which also showed a peak at 293 nm. All these data show that, in all probability, the 293 nm peak in the ORD of TM virus does not result from tryptophan-RNA interactions. It is believed that the difference in the optical activity of RNA particles of TM-like viruses do originate from the differences in the RNA-protein interactions in these viruses, but these interactions can hardly involve tryptophan residues of virus coat proteins.", "pmid": "856278", "mesh_set": "D002942 D008433 D009690 D009905 D012367 D013056 D014027", "score": 9.717652, "rank": 6070, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Trypsinization and carbamylation of the two conjugates demonstrates that the enhancement of their cellular uptake is related to their poly-L-lysine content. Simple addition to the medium of comparable amounts of free poly-L-lysine has no effect on the transport of either native protein. Addition of poly-L-ornithine (molecular weight 200,000) at 3-30 microgram/ml, a condition known to cause enhancement of 125I-labeled human serum albumin uptake by mouse sarcoma cells, has no visible effect on the cellular uptake of native horseradish peroxidase. The intracellular localization of the enzyme-poly-L-lysine conjugate can be demonstrated cytochemically by either light or transmission electron microscopy. A concentration of conjugate that increases the uptake more than 200-fold does not cause any detectable morphological change suggestive of cell toxicity.

{"title": "Neurotransmitter-related enzymes and indices of hypoxia in senile dementia and other abiotrophies.", "abstract": "Fifty-six brains from middle-aged and elderly normal as well as demented subjects and patients with provisional clinical diagnosis of other neurological and psychiatric diseases were assessed histologically. On this basis the specimens were classified into 14 diagnostic groups. A survey of potential indices of specific neurons has been carried out on these brains in which neurotransmitter-related enzymes, gamma-GTP (a potential index of capillaries) and specific proteins have been determined in up to 20 brain regions. In addition, the agonal state has been tentatively assessed by examining the post-mortem states of the circulatory and respiratory systems. CAT and gamma-GTP activities and the concentration of a soluble neuronal-type protein (neuronin S-5) were found to be relatively unaffected by the agonal state. When cases of senile dementia were compared to controls (matched with respect to the cause of death) the activity of CAT (the potential index of cholinergic neurons) appears to be reduced in the cerebral cortex. This is a preliminary finding, although a correlation was indicated between CAT activity and 'senile' morphological changes, the activity was markedly reduced in only 3 brains. However, despite inconsistencies in the literature (Karczmar, 1975) at least one pharmacological study on humans appears to show that the cholinergic system may be involved in age-related memory degeneration (Drachman and Leavitt, 1974). Cholinergic neurons may be abnormal in the other abiotrophies examined (Huntington's chorea, motor neuron disease and mixed vascular and senile dementia). gamma-GTP and neuronin S-5 (identical in most respects to the soluble acidic neuronal protein 14-3-2 of antigen alpha) were not reduced in senile dementia. The activities of brain decarboxylase (GAD and AAD) and the concentration of another soluble acidic brain protein (neuronin S-6) appear to be affected by the agonal state. This is remarkable because GAD and, in particular, neuronin S6, are relatively unaffected by post-mortem autolysis. As judged by the state of the extraneural systems which regulated the blood and oxygen supply to the brain it appears that terminal 'cerebral hypoxia' is responsible for the depletion of these brain constituents. This effect appears to be particularly marked in deep grey matter. In non-demented patients that die of bronchopneumonia, the areas of the cortex which are depleted in neuronin S-6 are consistent with the pattern of the 'selective vulnerability' of the cortex to hypoxia, suggesting that the terminal state can also affect the neocortex. If so, then this is particularly relevant to studies on senile dementia, for the effect of the terminal bronchopneumonia that so often occurs in these patients (and in patients with other abiotrophies) may be exacerbated by a terminal reduction in cerebral blood flow...", "pmid": "11871", "mesh_set": "D000328 D000368 D001927 D001996 D002262 D002421 D002540 D002795 D003704 D005968 D006801 D000860 D002534 D008875 D009419 D018377 D009929 D011180 D011655 D013997 D005723", "score": 24.793745, "rank": 1052, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Characterization of (+/-)-methadone uptake by rat lung.", "abstract": "1. By use of a sensitive and specific fluorescence assay procedure it was shown that after subcutaneous administration to rats, (+/-)-methadone was concentrated in the lung. Lung to serum ratios ranging from 25 to 60 were obtained indicating that the rat lung tissue was capable of extracting (+/-)-methadone against a concentration gradient. 2. This phenomenon was investigated in vitro with rat lung slices incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The uptake was expressed in terms of tissue to medium concentration ratios (T/M ratio). 3. The principal observations were: (i) Studies on the time-course of the uptake showed that the T/M ratios of (+/-)-methadone increased rapidly during the first 60 min of incubation and then more slowly, with a plateau occurring at 180 min; (ii) The T/M ratio of (+/-)-methadone progressively increased from 9.5 to 17 as the pH of the incubation medium was varied from 6.2 to 7.5; (iii) When the concentration of (+/-)-methadone in the incubation medium was varied from 0.005 to 0.5 mM, the T/M ratio decreased rapidly suggesting self-saturation of the transport process. Beyond the medium concentration of 0.5 mM, the T/M ratio declined very slowly. 4. These results suggested that at low concentrations, (+/-)-methadone was transported predominantly by a self-saturable process while at higher concentrations it was transported by a process of simple diffusion. 5.

The uptake of (+/-)-methadone at low concentration (0.01 mM) was significantly inhibited by low temperature, lack of O2, lack of glucose, lack of Na+ in the incubation medium, and by exposure of the tissue to high temperature (approximately 100 degrees C).

Exudate removed from a pneumococcal abscess contained material (eosinopenic factor [EF]) capable of causing eosinopenia of 4- to 24-h duration when injected intraperitoneally into eosinophilic mice. The material passed through a 0.45-micronm filter, but was retained by a dialysis membrane capable of retaining protein molecules of greater than approximately 30,000 molecular weight. EF was soluble in 7% perchloric acid, was not destroyed by pneumococcal proteolytic enzymes in the presence of Trasylol, but was inactivated by heating to 56 degrees C for 30 min. EF was detectable in the exudate after 10 h and had reached its highest concentration after 20 h. When the effect of EF was expressed as a percent suppression of control eosinophil levels, there was a geometric dose response. Eosinopenia could not be ascribed to steroids present in the preparation, and the EF was effective in adrenalectomized animals. Eosinopenia was not induced by transfer of similarly treated heat-killed pneumococci, pneumococcal culture filtrate, or normal serum.

This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of CPZ.

While auxin's role during fleshy fruit ripening is widely acknowledged to be important, the physiological functions of several ripening-induced genes, especially those involved in the maintenance of cellular auxin homeostasis, largely remain under-explored. In the present study, the updated inventory shows that 24 members constitute the Gretchen-Hagen 3 (GH3) gene family in tomato. Their characterization using an expression profiling approach revealed that SlGH3-2, a member of the group II IAA-amido synthetase, is strongly induced at the commencement of fruit ripening. Phylogenetic analysis and homology\u00a0modeling revealed that SlGH3-2 is the closest homolog of pepper CcGH3 and grapevine VvGH3-1. Expression profiling revealed that the mRNA level of SlGH3-2 is inhibited in ripening mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin) and Never-ripe (Nr). Whereas both auxin and ethylene were found to act as positive regulators of its transcript accumulation. The fruits of 35S::SlGH3-2 RNAi lines exhibited prolonged shelf-life. Both ethylene production and lycopene accumulation were affected in the fruits of SlGH3-2 silenced lines. These observations were corroborated by the altered expression of key ethylene and carotenoid biosynthesis genes such as ACS2 and PSY1, respectively, in the RNAi lines. Additionally, the SlGH3-2 silenced line fruits had higher IAA and IBA levels at the ripening stages, and showed increased transcript accumulation of several known auxin-induced SlIAA and SlGH3 genes. Altogether, the present study suggests that SlGH3-2 influences fruit ripening in tomato via modulating ethylene and auxin crosstalk, especially during the early phase.", "pmid": "30367324", "mesh_set": "D005030 D005638 D018506 D017343 D005818 D005822 D007210 D018551 D010802 D010937 D010940 D030821 D060888 D016415 D017385", "score": 14.494604, "rank": 4863, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Treatment of ewes with phenobarbital or phenylbutazone increased the rate of pentobarbital clearance from the circulation and shortened sleep time; treatment with diphenylhydantoin or chlorcyclizine decreased the rates of pentobarbital clearance from blood and increased sleep time. Treatment of rabbits with phenobarbital or diphenylhydantoin accelerated pentobarbital clearance from blood and shortened sleep time; chlorcyclizine had no effect on blood pentobarbital concentrations or sleep time. The results suggest that accelerated or delayed clearance of pentobarbital from the circulation was largely responsible for shortened or prolonged sleep times.

The KA of l-NE and the KA of a second agonist, when determined on paired strips from the same aorta, were used to calculate the relative affinity and the relative efficacy (er) of the second agonist as compared to l-NE. The validity of the method used for determining KA and er values was supported by the following findings. 1) The dissociation constant (KB) of the competitive antagonist, phentolamine, determined with each of the agonists, was the same as that determined with l-NE. 2) The KA determined for l-NE was independent of the fraction of active receptors remaining (q) after pretreatment with different concentrations of Dibenamine. 3) The KB of phentolamine determined with l-NE as the agonist was the same before and after fractional inactivation of receptors. 4) After inactivation in paired strips by equal exposures to Dibenamine, the q value determined with each agonist was the same as that determined with l-NE.

A study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated and cross-reinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal (iliofibularis) or a distributed (sartorius) innervation from 'en plaque' nerve terminals using histological, ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques. 2. During the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the adult frog, the sartorius myofibres increased in length at about twice the rate of the iliofibularis myofibres, due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions on to the pelvic tendon. 3. The short iliofibularis and sartorius myofibres of young tadpoles (800 mum long) possessed only a single synapse and the iliofibularis myofibres did not receive any further innervation during development. However the sartorius myofibres received further transient innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing pelvic insertion, until the distance between the original synapse formed on the myofibres and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about 12 mm. 4. During development synapses possessed either skewed, multimodal, or unimodal m.e.p.p. amplitude-frequency distributions; the intervals between m.e.p.p.s. were not distributed randomly according to a Poisson process, as m.e.p.p.s. of similar amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals; the unit-size e.p.p. had a similar amplitude-frequency distribution as the m.e.p.p.s. if these had a unimodal distribution. 5. Reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of the sartorius and the iliofibularis muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the muscles, as found in the control muscles of the contralateral and unoperated legs. 6. These observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with the hypothesis that during development the axon making the initial synaptic contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation; thus during reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of adult muscles this refractory property constrains synapse formation to these sites.", "pmid": "494", "mesh_set": "D000663 D000818 D001001 D002024 D004594 D007814 D008675 D009121 D024510 D009132 D009210 D009416 D009469 D018377 D013569", "score": 8.190489, "rank": 6118, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Relative utilization of fatty acids for synthesis of ketone bodies and complex lipids in the liver of developing rats.", "abstract": "The regulation of hepatic ketogenesis, as related to the metabolism of fatty acids through oxidative and synthetic pathways, was studied in developing rats. [1-14C] palmitate was used as a substrate to determine the proportions of free fatty acids utilized for the production of ketone bodies, CO2 and complex lipids. Similar developmental patterns of hepatic ketogenesis were obtained by measuring the production of either [14C] acetoacetate from exogenous [1-14C] palmitate or the sum of unlabeled acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate from endogenous fatty acids. The production of total ketone bodies was low during the late fetal stage and at birth, but increased rapidly to a miximum value within 24 hr after brith. The maximal ketogenic capacity appeared to be maintained for the first 10 days of life. 14CO2 production from [1-14C] palmitate increased by two- to fourfold during the suckling period, from its initial low rate seen at birth. The capacity for synthesis of total complex lipids was low at birth and had increased by day 3 to a maximal value, which was comparable to that of adult fed rats. The high lipogenic capacity lasted throughout the remaining suckling period. When ketogenesis was inhibited by 4-pentenoic acid, the rate of synthesis of complex lipids did not increase despite an increase in unutilized fatty acids. During the mid-suckling period, approximately equal amounts of [1-14C] palmitate were utilized for the synthesis of ketone plus CO2 and for complex lipid synthesis. By contrast, in adult fed rats, the incorporation of fatty acids into complex lipids was four times higher than that of ketone plus CO2. These observations suggest that stimulated hepatic ketogenesis in suckling rats results from the rapid oxidation of fatty acids and consequent increased production of acetyl CoA, but not from impaired capacity for synthesis of complex lipids.", "pmid": "857111", "mesh_set": "D000090 D000375 D000818 D002784 D002788 D005260 D005333 D005989 D006885 D007657 D008055 D008099 D008297 D010169 D010743 D011247 D051381", "score": 20.87327, "rank": 1949, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "The effects of pH changes on the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials at the frog neuromuscular junction.", "abstract": "As reported by Landau & Nachshen (1975), a decrease in extracellular pH at the frog neuromuscular junction leads to an increase in min.e.p.p. frequency. 2. Decreasing the extracellular pH still increases the min.e.p.p. frequency when the bathing Ringer contains 10 mM-Ca2+, in place of the usual 2-5 mM. At the mammalian neuromuscular junction, the elevated Ca2+ blocks the effect of the pH change on the min.e.p.p. frequency (Hubbard, Jones & Landau, 1968). 3. In Cl--free solution (isethionate or methylsulphate substitution) min.e.p.p. frequency is no longer a monotonic function of decreasing pH. Instead there is an optimum pH for spontaneous release between pH 6-6 and 8-6. 4. This suggests that in Cl- containing Ringer min.e.p.p. frequency increases with increasing extracellular acidity because there is a change in the PCl of the nerve terminal leading to a depolarization. In agreement with this idea,in low Ca2+ Ringer, acid pH has little effect on the min.e.p.p. frequency. 5. Decreasing the intracellular pH by raising PCO2 produces substantial increases in the min.e.p.p. frequency. The effects are much greater than the effects of equal changes of H+ in the extracellular solution. 6. Possible explanations for the effects of increased PCO2 are discussed. Although release of Ca2+ from mitochondria or other unknown effects of intracellular pH change or molecular CO2 are possible, the results do give some support to the hypothesis that an important step in transmitter release involves an electrostatic repulsion between fixed membrane surface charges on the transmitter containing vesicles and the inner face of the nerve terminal. The surface charge density would be decreased by a lower pH in the axoplasm, and this would increase the rate of spontaneous transmitter release, in agreement with the observations.", "pmid": "11340", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002118 D002245 D002712 D005110 D006863 D066298 D007424 D008564 D009045 D009469 D011894 D009435", "score": 22.238651, "rank": 1560, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

It is proposed that periodate oxidation of glycol groups in the repeating units of polysaccharide molecules can be used to probe differences in polymer shapes in solution. 2. Measurement of second-order rate constants (k2) of periodate-glycol reactions may be compared between polymers and relevant monomers, to assess perturbations due to polymer configuration. 3. Factors effecting the measurement and interpretation of k2 are discussed. Over-oxidation, free-radical side reactions, end-group effects, Donnan equilibria and polymer (or molecular-weight) effects are relevant, but their importance is either small or can be minimized in practice. 4. A small group of glycosaminoglycuronans (chondroitin 4- and 6-sulphates and hyaluronate) are oxidized 50--100 times more slowly than three other glycosaminoglycuronans of similar composition, relevant monomers or three homopolyuronides. 5. A stable configuration in solution is postulated for the periodate-resistant polymers, involving carboxylate, acetamido and hydroxy groups in hydrogen-bonded sequences on alternate sides of the molecule. The more easily oxidizable polyuronides are unable to form this configuration. 6. The effect of temperature on the postulated configuration is investigated through the Arrhenius plot of k2, measured to hyaluronate, chondroitin 6-sulphate and methyl 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. Probable transitions at high (around 90 degrees C) temperatures were observed for both polymers, with an additional transition at about 37 degrees C in the case of hyaluronate. 7.

However, with 2--4 mg/kg doses, the maximum effect of BOL was larger than that of LSD. LSD and BOL antagonized the apomorphine-induced decrease of DOPA accumulation, without affecting the haloperidol-induced increase. LSD like apomorphine inhibited the increase of DOPA accumulation seen after reserpine, cerebral hemisection and after gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). The effect of apomorphine in rats given GBL was blocked by haloperidol, but not by BOL and promethazine, whereas that of LSD was inhibited by haloperidol, BOL, and promethazine. These findings suggest that LSD and BOL directly affect nigro-neostriatal dopamine neurons. LSD therefore appears to be a partial agonist and BOL a pure antagonist at dopamine autoreceptors.

{"title": "Effect of serotonin on water and electrolyte transport in the in vivo rabbit small intestine.", "abstract": "The influence of intravenously administered serotonin on water and electrolyte fluxes in the in vivo rabbit jejunum and ileum was examined. Animals were divided into four groups: (1) those receiving saline intravenously while a glucose-free isotonic saline solution perfused the jejunum and ileum; (2) serotonin given intravenously while glucose-free intestinal perfusate was used as in group 1; (3) intravenous saline given while a 10 mM glucose-isotonic saline solution perfused the jejunum and ileum; and (4) intravenous serotonin given while the intestinal perfusate was as in group 3. Serotonin administration resulted in highly significant net secretion of H2O and sodium in both jejunum and ileum in the groups with a glucose-free perfusate. In jejunum, serotonin evoked net water and sodium secretion, whereas controls absorbed water and sodium. In ileum, serotonin significantly enhanced secretion. The addition of glucose to the perfusate completely abolished the serotonin effect. Unidirectional 22Na flux analysis revealed a marked diminution in both mucosal to serosal and serosal to mucosal fluxes in serotonin-treated animals. The decrease in mucosal to serosal flux was greater than the decrease in serosal to mucosal flux, thus explaining the enhanced net secretion observed with serotonin in the groups receiving glucose-free perfusate. In spite of its pronounced effect on water and electrolyte transport, serotonin failed to produce any detectable histological alterations in small bowel mucosa, either by light or electron microscopy.

{"title": "Delayed myeloradiculopathy produced by spinal X-irradiation in the rat.", "abstract": "Rats were subjected to 3,500 r of X-irradiation in a single dose while breathing oxygen at 1 ATM pressure. Comparison was made between the delayed effects of irradiating thoracic, lumbar, and the cauda equina fields. The lumbar field involved the alpha-motoneurons and spinal roots supplying the sciatic nerve, while the cauda equina field involved these spinal roots but spared the alpha-motoneurons in the spinal cord. Thoracic irradiation produced paraplegia after an interval of 127-150 days. In the irradiated zone, the spinal cord was severely damaged, but the thoracic spinal roots were spared. Lumbar irradiation produced paraplegia after an interval of 83-211 days. In the irradiated zone, the alpha-motoneurons were largely spared, the spinal cord showed mild to moderate white matter damage, but the most severe damage was of the lumbosacral spinal roots. The posterior roots were more affected than the anterior. In longer interval cases the degeneration of the roots appeared to be due to focal devitalization. Evidence is advanced that root degeneration had been progressing for at least 4 weeks before the onset of paraplegia. In the cauda equina series the lumbosacral spinal root changes were similar to those in the lumbar series. This study indicates that different levels of the neuraxis have different degrees of susceptibility to X-irradiation. The thoracic cord appears more susceptible than the lumbosacral; the lumbosacral roots appear more susceptible than the thoracic; the posterior roots are more susceptible than the anterior.

Homogenization of muscle tissue in salt-containing solutions leads to contamination of this subcellular fraction with actomyosin and mitochondrial membranes. When, in addition, inorganic cations are contributed by the microsomal suspension and in association with nucleotide triphosphate substrates there is an apparent inhibition of the calcium transport system by potassium and other cations. However, when purified preparations were obtained after homogenization in sucrose medium followed by centrifugation on a sucrose density gradient in a zonal rotor, calcium uptake and the associated adenosine triphosphatase activity were considerably activated by potassium and other univalent cations. When plotted against the log of the free calcium concentration there was only a slight increase in calcium uptake and ATPase activity in the absence of potassium ions but sigmoid-shaped curves were obtained in 100 mM K+ with half-maximal stimulation occurring at 2 muM Ca2+ for both calcium uptake and ATPase activity. The augmentation in calcium uptake was not due to an ionic strength effect as Tris cation at pH 6.6 was shown to be inactive in this respect. Other monovalent cations were effective in the order K+ greater than Na+ greater than NH4+=Rb+=Cs+ greater than Li+ with half-maximal stimulation in 11 mM K+, 16 mM Na+, 25 mM NH4+, Rb+, and Cs+ and in 50 mM Li+. There was nos synergistic action between K+ AND Na+ ions and both calcium uptak and associated ATPase were insensitive to ouabain. Thallous ions  stimulate many K+-requiring enzymes and at one-tenth the concentration were nearly as effective as K+ ions in promoting calcium uptake. The ratio of Ca2+ ions transported to P1 released remained unchanged at 2 after addition of K+ ions indicating an effect on the rate of calcium uptake rather than an increased efficiency of uptake. In support of this it was found that during the stimulation of calcium uptake by Na+ ions there was a reduction in the steady state concentration of phosphorylated intermediate formed from [gamma-32P]ATP.

Canal-canal and utricle-canal interactions were recorded using various condition-test parameters. The brain stem was sectioned to eliminate influence of the contralateral vestibular nuclei, and the condition-test experiments were repeated. The type of interaction observed (inhibition or facilitation) and the degree to which it occurred were dependent on the MLF recording site. Also, in the case of utricular interactions, these were dependent on the site of utricular stimulation. These dependencies indicate a topological arrangement from receptor cell through the second order neuronal projection pathways. Sectioning of the brain stem produced changes in the interaction patterns, indicating masking and/or balancing of the ipsilateral interactions. In interactions between the anterior and posterior canals, instances of no apparent interaction occurring before sectioning converted to inhibition after sectioning. This indicates that some facilitative interaction occurs involving feedback from the contralateral vestibular nuclei, and this facilitation masks or balances ipsilateral inhibition. In interactions between the anterior and horizontal canals, contralateral inhibitory influence masks ipsilateral facilitatory interactions. Contralateral facilitatory influence again balances ipsilateral inhibition in interactions between the horizontal and posterior canals. The degree of inhibition and facilitation observed indicates that considerably more polysynaptic ipsilateral convergence on second order vestibular neurons occurs than has been demonstrated in intracellular studies. Only inhibition was observed when the anterior canal was conditioned by stimulation of the utricular nerve after sectioning. In all other pairings, mixed effects were observed. It is suggested that this is related to known functional connections of semicircular canal second order neurons with neck motoneurons.

{"title": "Colestipol, clofibrate, and phytosterols in combined therapy of hyperlipidemia.", "abstract": "Studies were carried out to determine effects of combined chemotherapy in patients with hyperlipidemia. In one study, 14 patients were treated first with colestipol and then with the combination of colestipol and clofibrate. In a second study, six patients were given clofibrate followed by addition of phytosterols. The following measurements were made in most patients: (1) plasma lipid concentrations, (2) fecal excretions of neutral steroids and bile acids, and (3) lipid composition of gallbladder bile. In six patients of the first study, hepatic secretion rates of biliary lipids and pool sizes of bile acids were also estimated. In the first study, colestipol alone caused a marked increase in fecal bile acids that resulted in a sizable decrease in plasma cholesterol concentrations (average 21 percent). In several patients, however, triglycerides were increased somewhat by colestipol. Despite interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, the bile acid pool was not reduced, since a compensatory increase took place in bile acid synthesis. Also, except in one patient who developed gallstones following institution of colestipol, saturation of gallbladder bile with cholesterol was not markedly increased by this drug alone. Addition of clofibrate frequently produced a further decrement in plasma cholesterol, and the mild hypertriglyceridemia induced by colestipol was reversed. However, colestipol plus clofibrate usually caused a striking increase in saturation of gallbladder bile. Previous studies have shown that clofibrate causes a flux of cholesterol from tissue pools by simultaneously decreasing cholesterol synthesis and increasing its excretion. To further increase cholesterol excretion, phytosterols, which block cholesterol absorption, were added to clofibrate in the second study. Although phytosterols did not cause a further reduction in plasma cholesterol in these particular patients, they nevertheless greatly enhanced cholesterol excretion.", "pmid": "833472", "mesh_set": "D000328 D001646 D001647 D002784 D002994 D003084 D004359 D005243 D006801 D006937 D006949 D050356 D008099 D008297 D008875 D010840 D011073 D013256 D014280", "score": 13.218054, "rank": 5373, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The increase in glucose oxidation was evident in experiments in which [U-14C], [1-14C], or [6-14C]glucose was added to the media, but it was absent when the media were supplemented with pyruvate. Incorporation of glucose into glycogen and accumulation of lactate in the medium were not seriously modified by the presence of cycloheximide. The stimulatory effect of cycloheximide on incorporation of glucose into lipids was absent when insulin or cortisol was added to the medium.

The plasma membrane-bound enzyme was not activated, although hormone receptors were present. Stimulation was augmented by NaN3, which by itself had little effect on the soluble enzyme activity. With a partially purified enzyme, activity was enhanced by 0.1 muM 1-epinephrine and activated half-maximally by about 1 muM. In decreasing potency, epinephrine greater than isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than dopamine greater than catechol. Phenylephrine and metanephrine did not stimulate. 1-Epinephrine-stimulation of the enzyme was reversed by dialysis and the deactivated enzyme was reactivatable by a second exposure to the catecholamine. Activation by catecholamines was not stereospecific. Epinephrine-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity in the crude cytosolic fraction was partially inhibited by alpha-adrenergic antagonists, but neither alpha- nor beta-blockers inhibited when the partially purified enzyme was used; thus, leaving open the question of a role for typical alpha- or beta-adrenergic mechanisms in this regulation of the soluble enzyme. Adrenochrome was the most potent activator of the partially purified guanylate cyclase, being approximately 10-times more effective than epinephrine. Epinephrine and adrenochrome activated in the presence of reducing agents, i.e., ascorbate, DTT and N2, although the enzyme in a more SH-reduced form and in an oxygen-deficient medium had a decreased sensitivity to both effectors.

It could be shown that complex formation proceeds in two distinct steps. This was demonstrated for both the first and the second binding site. The two-step mechanism was deduced from the characteristic concentration dependence of the relaxation times. Seryl-tRNA synthetase recombines with the first tRNA to form an intermediate complex (kI12, kI21), which is transformed in a fast reaction to the final 1:1 complex (kI23, kI32). At pH 7.2 with 0.1 M KCl the rate constants are: kI12 = 2.7 X 10(8) M-1 S-1; kI23, kI32). At pH 7.2 with 0.1 M KCl the rate constants are: kI12 = 2.7 x 10(8) M-1 S-1; kI21 = 220 S-1; kI23 = 760 S-1; kI32 = 330 S-1. The 1:1 complex can bind a second tRNA.

{"title": "Pyruvate metabolism in bovine epididymal spermatozoa.", "abstract": "Treating bovine epididymal spermatozoa with rutamycin or rotenone inhibited both respiration and motility supported by endogenous substrates. When oxidative phosphorylation had been blocked with various inhibitors, pyruvate was metabolized to yield ATP and restored motility. Fructose, which is metabolized via glycolysis to yield ATP, was also able to resuscitate the cells. Other substrates tested (lactate, acetate, alpha-ketoglutarate, or glyoxylate) were unable to restore motility in rutamycin-treated cells. In the presence of pyruvate, the phosphorylation uncoupler, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethyoxphenylhydrazone, reduced motility and ATP to common levels in untreated cells or cells treated with rutamycin or rotenone. Pyruvate is thus metabolized to produce ATP by a pathway independent of oxidative phosphorylation associated with the electron transport chain. 5-Methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, an inhibitor of lipoyldehydrogenase, prevented the increase of motility and ATP in rutamycin-treated cells, indicating that alpha-keto acid oxidation is involved in the production of ATP from pyruvate when rutamycin is present. With pyruvate present, bongkrekic acid, antimycin A, and anaerobiosis eliminated motility, reduced ATP to low levels, and also significantly reduced the rate of pyruvate metabolism. Acetate was produced from pyruvate only when cellular ATP concentrations were low. Decreases in free carnitine concentrations showed that pyruvate initially used was converted to acetylcarnitine. The results indicate that the intramitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase X, which is unique to spermatozoa, allows the NADH resulting from pyruvate oxidation to reduce other pyruvate molecules to lactate. Pyruvate thus competes with, and can substitute for, the NADH dehydrogenase of the electron transport chain. Pyruvate rapidly repletes the acetylcarnitine pool under a variety of conditions.", "pmid": "838718", "mesh_set": "D000244 D000249 D000255 D000818 D000900 D001865 D002259 D002331 D002417 D004822 D007700 D008297 D011773 D012402 D012427 D013081 D013094 D014698", "score": 12.797842, "rank": 5525, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

To establish the receptive fields the skin of all four limbs and of the trunk was probed with mechanical stimuli (taps, air-jets, pressure). The recording sites in the vermis were determined histologically. 2. In regard to the mossy fiber transmitted input none of the four limbs showed a dominant representation in one or more of the lobules rostral of the fissura prima or in a parasagittal section. For the ipsilateral limbs there is a greater mossy fiber input to lobule V from the forelimb than from the hindlimb (84:59%), and a reversed preponderance for lobule II (45:80%) but this indication of a somatotopic arrangement is not unequivocally paralleled by the other mossy fiber inputs. 3. Also in regard to the climbing fiber input no distinct somatotopical arrangement has been detected. Again it has been noted that the ipsilateral inputs have a somewhat greater input to lobule V from the forelimb than from the hindlimb (35:22%), and the reverse finding holds true for lobule II (10:45%). 4. The overall results did not change appreciably when the  responses were grouped according to their latencies or when the Purkyn\u0115 cells were classified according to the patterns of convergence of their receptive fields. 5. The absence of a distinct somatotopic organization in the vermis is a direct consequence of the considerable convergence from the cutaneous mechanoreceptors of the limbs onto the individual Purkyn\u0115 cells which occurs via the mossy and the climbing fiber pathways.

The thyroid hormone does not act by substituting for any of the other hormones. It need not be present throughout the culture period but can act if added along with prolactin after insulin and hydrocortisone have induced formation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Delayed addition of the thyroid hormone also results in further stimulation of cells already responding maximally to insulin, hydrocortisone and prolactin. These effects of triiodothyronine are not blocked by progesterone at 1 microng per ml. They are, however, blocked by the addition of inhibitors of RNA (actinomycin D) or protein (cycloheximide or puromycin) synthesis, suggesting that the thyroid hormone increases the synthesis of the alpha-lactalbumin molecule itself. The thyroid hormone appears to act by altering the responsiveness of the mammary gland explants to prolactin, but not to insulin or hydrocortisone.

One major protein band, corresponding to a molecular weight of 32 500, was observed on 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of pooled fractions from DEAE-cellulose column chromatography (128-fold purified). The pH optimum for the 64-fold purified enzyme isolated from Bio-Gel A 1.5 M chromatography was 4.2 and bile salt hydrolase activity measured in intact cell suspensions had a pH optimum of 4.5. Substrate specificity studies indicated that taurine and glycine conjugates of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid were readily hydrolyzed; however, lithocholic acid conjugates were not hydrolyzed. Substrate saturation kinetics were biphasic with an intermediate plateau (0.2--0.3 mM) and a complete loss of enzymatic activity was observed at high concentration for certain substrates.

{"title": "Toxicity of ammonia to algae in sewage oxidation ponds.", "abstract": "Ammonia, at concentrations over 2.0 mM and at pH values over 8.0, inhibits photosynthesis and growth of Scenedesmus obliquus, a dominant species in high-rate sewage oxidation ponds. Photosynthesis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Anacystis nidulans, and Plectonema boryanum is also susceptible to ammonia inhibition. Dark respiration and cell morphology were unaffected by any combination of pH and ammonia concentrations tested, thus limiting the apparent effect to inhibition of the normal function of the chloroplasts. Methylamine had the same effect as ammonia, and its penetration into the cells was found to be pH dependent. Therefore, the dependence of toxicity of amines to algae on pH apparently results from the inability to penetrate the cell membrane in the ionized form. When operated at 120-h detention time of raw wastewater, the high-rate oxidation pond maintained a steady state with respect to algal growth and oxygen concentration, and the concentration of ammonia did not exceed 1.0 mM. Shifting the pond to 48-h detention time caused an increase in ammonia concentration in the pond water to 2.5 mM, and the pond gradually turned anaerobic. Photosynthesis, which usually elevates the pH of the pond water to 9.0 to 10.0, could not proceed beyond pH 7.9 because of the high concentration of ammonia, and the algal population was washed out and reduced to a concentration that could maintain a doubling time of 48 h without photosynthesis bringing the pH to inhibitory levels. Under these conditions, the pH of the bond becomes a factor that limits the operational efficiency of the oxidation pond.", "pmid": "7192", "mesh_set": "D000641 D002245 D002463 D002734 D000460 D000458 D006863 D008744 D010788 D012722 D014871", "score": 15.398486, "rank": 4386, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Although growth of the original uncloned cell line is only slightly retarded by dexamethasone, sensitive clones were isolated in which growth is completely blocked by 2 to 3 days of exposure to 10(-6) M dexamethasone. After 4 to 5 days, these cells become pyknotic and lyse. The inhibitory affect of dexamethasone first become apparent in suspension culture at a concentration of about 5 X 10(-8) M. Receptor analysis showed the presence of specific glucocorticoid receptors with an apparent dissociation constant for dexamethasone of about 1.3 X 10(-8) M both in the sensitive and in one resistant clone analyzed. Ability to displace dexamethasone from the receptor is correlated with the known glucocorticoid activity of all steroids tested, as is their ability to inhibit cloning of sensitive cells in agarose. These results indicate that the specificity of inhibitory effects is related to receptor specificity of inhibitory effects is related to receptor specificity. Dexamethasone is a potent inhibitor when cells are cloned in agarose, having a marked effect even at a concentration of 7 X 10(-9) M.

ATP hydrolysis was estimated from the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated. An analysis of the total degradation of ATP was initially performed to ensure that the enzyme assays pertained to the original substrate, ATP, and were not influenced by reaction products formed. Standard incubations were run in tris-maleate buffer, pH 8.2, with 3 mM ATP, 3 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM R 8231 at 37 degrees C. The presence of R 8231 was necessary to inhibit nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. The calcium-stimulated ATPase was completely inhibited when heated at 55-60 degrees C for 5 min. The pH optimum was found to be 8.2. The hydrolysis was substantially dependent on Ca2+ and was fastest when the ATP:Ca2+ ratio was 1:1. High substrate concentrations inhibited the hydrolysis. The addition of 1 mM Zn2+ and Ni2+ to the incubation medium markedly inhibited the hydrolysis as did, though less strongly, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, oligomycin, EDTA and ruthenium red. l-Cysteine, mercaptoethanol, iodoacetic acid and sodium azide were without effect.

The importance of other ionic movements that might contribute to pH changes of luminal buffers (chloride inflow into the lumen and bicarbonate diffusion across the epithelium) was assessed but found to be minor. H ion movements accounted for the majority of the observed pH changes. 3. H ion permeability of the tubular wall was calculated from the measured H fluxes and transepithelial concentration differences. It was 1-10 cm/sec, several orders of magnitude larger than those for other ions. However, such values are compatible with the mobility of protons in a medium of structure water within the limiting membrane. 4. A kinetic analysis of the mechanism of movement of H ions across the renal tubule is presented on the basis of experiments in which acidification and alkalinization of luminal buffers was followed in stationary microperfusions.

Such changes were qualitatively similar to those seen in rats fed a normal diet, but deprived of water for 24 hours. After 12 days, the Li-supplemented rats had elevated plasma ADH titres, but reduced pituitary oxytocic and antidiuretic activities. 3. The urinary losses of Na, K and Cl exceeded dietary intakes in LE rats on the introduction of the Li-supplement, and the urinary osmolarity fell by 50%. Electrolyte balances were gradually re-established, although drinking and urine production increased in parallel to reach twice the control values by day 12 of the supplement. 4. Aldosterone and corticosterone secretory rates and their peripheral plasma concentrations were unchanged both after 24 h and 28 days of the Li-supplement. 5. Li elicited no water deficit or saluresis in DI rats, and although the polyuria and polydipsia were exacerbated, urinary osmolarity did not change over the 12 day observation period. 6.

Applying these equations to the present data, we observed the presence of an oscillatory cosine term in the equation for each hormone. This indicates significant oscillations in serum T4, T3, and TSH concentrations during the first 5 days of life. The period of the oscillations approximates 16 h. The oscillations in T4, lag 1/2 to 3/4 cycle behind TSH; T3 lags behind T4.

Appl. Physiol. 38: 504-512, 1975). It was proposed that the H+ formed in the CNS in CO2 hydration is actively exchanged for plasma Na+ utilizing the Na-K ATPase pump. H+ transport from the CNS was therefore studied in four groups of dogs breathing 5% CO2 at constant VA for 4 h with repeated injections of saline, acetazolamide 5 mg/ml, ouabain 0.1 mg/ml, and acetazolamide and ouabain together into lateral cerebral ventricles.

CSF HCO3-increased 5.8 meq/l in the saline-injected animals, but it increased only about 2 meq/l and equaled plasma HCO3- rise in the other three groups. Therefore CNS HCO3- formation in hypercapnia can be blocked by inhibiting the CO2 hydration reaction with acetazolamide or by blocking H+ removal by inhibiting Na-K ATPase with ouabain.

In the absence of carrier, decreases of 203Hg2+ activities in media stored in either container were more pronounced due to chemisorption (but) not diffusion. The following factors affecting the removal of mercurials from aqueous solution stored in glass were examined: type and concentration of adsorbent (fiber glass and rubber powder); pH; pretreatment of the rubber; and the form of mercury used. Rubber was equally effective in the adsorption of organic and inorganic mercury. The pH of the aqueous 203Hg2+ solution was not a critical factor in the rate of adsorption of mercury by the rubber. In addition, the effect of soaking the rubber in water for 18 hr did not show any statistical difference when compared with nontreated rubber.

The in vitro experiments with HeLa cells show that VCR affects not only mitotic but also interphase cells. The VCR-affected cells first continue their passage through the cell cycle undisturbed but after reaching mitosis they are arrested in metaphase. This agrees well with the results obtained by Madoc-Jones & Mauro (1968) and Madoc-Jones (1973) on synchronized cell cultures. Until now there has been no investigation of the mechanism of action of VCR in vivo. This is due to the absence of a suitable technique for synchronization in vivo. The present study is based on a method which permits the assessment of the VCR sensitivity as a function of the cell age without synchronization in the usual sense. The jejunal crypt epithelium of the normal mouse was double labelled with 3H- and 14C-thymidine (TdR) in such a way as to produce a narrow subpopulation of crypt cells with a maximum age difference of 1 hr. On autoradiographs these cells can be distinguished by their characteristic labelling from other cells. As this 'pseudo'-synchronized subpopulation passes through the cycle the effect of VCR can be studied, i.e. one can analyse the effect in well-defined time intervals of the cycle. The results show that the effect of VCR is the same in vivo as in vitro. The crypt cells which are affected by VCR in interphase continue their passage through the cycle, but upon entering mitosis they are arrested in metaphase. VCR has, at the concentration used in the present study, no effect on the duration of the S and G2 phases.

The cytosol enzyme was purified 977-fold from whole seedlings by steps involving manganese chloride treatment, ammonium sulphate and acetone fractionations, positive adsorption on alumina C-gamma gel, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography followed by preparative disc gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by electrophoretic and immunological criteria, had a molecular weight of 220,000 and appears to be a hexamer with identical subunits. The optimal pH and temperature for the enzyme activity were 8.5 and 45 degrees C respectively. The enzyme follows typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 1.73 mM for arginine. Though Mn2+ at lower concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity, there was no dependence of the enzyme on any metal for the activity. The arginine decarboxylase of L. sativus is a sulfhydryl enzyme. The data on co-factor requirement, inhibition by carbonyl reagents, reducing agents and pyridoxal phosphate inhibitors, and a partial reversal by pyridoxal phosphate of inhibition by pyridoxal-HCl suggests that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is involved as a co-factor for the enzyme. The enzyme activity was inhibited competitively by various amines including the product agmatine. Highest inhibition was obtained with spermine and arcain. The substrate analogue, L-canavanine, homologue L-homoarginine and other basic amino acids like L-lysine and L-ornithine inhibited the enzyme activity competitively, homoarginine being the most effective in this respect.", "pmid": "1252", "mesh_set": "D000596 D002262 D003600 D004355 D006863 D005779 D007700 D046911 D008345 D008970 D063245 D010944 D011732 D013347 D013439 D013696", "score": 24.960064, "rank": 1027, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "The kinetics of reoxidation of reduced benzylamine oxidase.", "abstract": "1. The mechanism of reoxidation of reduced benzylamine oxidase has been investigated at different pH between 6 and 10 by steady-state and transient-state kinetic methods. 2. The reoxidation process involves minimally a second-order interaction between reduced enzyme and oxygen leading to the formation of a spectrally modified enzyme intermediate, and a subsequent first-order step converting this intermediate into free enzyme. The variation with pH of rate constants according to such a reaction scheme is reported. 3. Under aerobic conditions the oxygen-independent reaction represents the main rate-limiting step in the catalytic process at alkaline pH. At neutral or acid pH the interaction between reduced enzyme and oxygen becomes mainly rate-limiting, indicating that the concentration of oxygen may be a critical factor controlling enzyme activity under physiological conditions. 4. The spectrally modified intermediate formed during the reoxidation process exhibits a difference-absorption band centered around 290 nm in comparison to free enzyme, and an additional difference-absorption band at 470 nm in comparison to reduced enzyme. These data indicate that formation of the intermediate, besides leading to a reappearance of the 470-nm absorption band disappearing on reduction of the enzyme, results in a spectral perturbation of one or several aromatic amino-acid residues in the protein.

{"title": "Interaction of human chorionic gonadotropin with membrane components of rat testes.", "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrating that gangliosides interacted with thyrotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) suggested that gangliosides participate in the transduction of the hormonal message across the target cell membrane. As a continuation of these investigations, we examined the effects of down-regulation of hCG receptors on the interaction of hCG with rat testis membrane components. Rat testes contained a complex ganglioside pattern that did not appear to change qualitatively or quantitatively after the injection of hCG into the animals, although testis membranes from hCG-treated rats lost their capacity to bind (125)I-labeled hCG ((125)I-hCG). Gangliosides extracted from the testes of control and treated animals were equally effective inhibitors of (125)I-hCG binding to testis membranes. However, inhibition of binding was observed only under conditions (pH 6.0, low ionic strength) such that unlabeled hCG (>2500-fold excess) did not block (125)I-hCG binding, and (125)I-hCG bound similarly to testis membranes from control and treated rats. Under conditions such that hCG binding was specific (blocked by 250-fold excess of unlabeled hCG), testis gangliosides were noninhibitory. Liposomes containing gangliosides from the testes of control or hCG-treated rats bound similar small amounts of (125)I-hCG. These same liposomes bound 50 and 1000 times more thyrotropin and cholera toxin, respectively, than hCG. Oligosaccharides derived from gangliosides did not inhibit (125)I-hCG binding to testis membranes nor did they alter the fluorescence of hCG conjugated with fluorescent probes, whereas the gangliosides themselves were inhibitory and enhanced the fluorescence intensity of the hCG derivatives. Exposure of testis membranes from hCG-treated rats to 4 M MgCl(2), which displaces bound hCG [Chen, Y.-D. I. & Payne, A. H. (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 74, 1589-1596], did not restore their ability to bind (125)I-hCG. When membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100, a solubilized receptor was detected from testis membranes of control but not hCG-treated rats. These findings and the absence of demonstrable changes in the composition or quantity of rat testis gangliosides when hCG receptors are down-regulated suggest that gangliosides do not represent the primary binding determinants of hCG receptors.", "pmid": "24844", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001667 D002462 D006063 D005732 D006863 D008081 D008274 D008297 D009844 D011092 D051381 D011956 D013737", "score": 14.591273, "rank": 4817, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

NADH oxidase activity was unaffected; NADPH oxidase and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenase activities were diminished by less than 10%. When ETP was incubated with trypsin at 30 degrees, NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost, NADPH oxidase activity was slowly destroyed, but NADH oxidase activity remained intact. The reduction pattern by NADPH, NADPH + NAD, and NADH of chromophores absorbing at 475 minus 510 nm (flavin and iron-sulfur centers) in complex I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase) or ETP treated with trypsin at 0 degrees also indicated specific destruction of transhydrogenase activity. The sensitivity of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible arginyl residues in the enzyme. Arginyl residues are considered to be positively charged binding sites for anionic substrates and ligands in many enzymes. Treatment of ETP with the specific arginine-binding reagent, butanedione, inhibited transhydrogenation from NADPH leads to NAD (or AcPyAD). It had no effect on NADH oxidation, and inhibited NADPH oxidation and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenation by only 10 to 15% even after 30 to 60 min incubation of ETP with butanedione. The inhibition of NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation was diminished considerably when butanedione was added to ETP in the presence of NAD or NADP. When both NAD and NADP were present, the butanedione effect was completely abolished, thus suggesting the possible presence of arginyl residues at the nucleotide binding site of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase enzyme. Under conditions that transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD was completely inhibited by trypsin or butanedione, NADPH oxidation rate was larger than or equal to 220 nmol min-1 mg-1 ETP protein at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees.

{"title": "Transport and phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-D-galactase in renal cortical cells.", "abstract": "The transport and phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]galactose in rabbit renal cortical cells was studied. 1. The uptake of 2-deoxy-galactose by cortical slices is associated with an appearance of both free and phosphorylated sugar in the cells. At 1 mM external sugar the cells establish a steady-state gradient of free 2-deoxy-galactose of 3.97 +/- 0.15 (23 animals). 2. The acid-labile sugar phosphate accumulated in the tissue has been identified by a combination of paper and radio-chromatography, as well as on the basis of some of its chemical properties, as 2-deoxy-D-galactose 1-phosphate. Ice-cold trichloroacetic acid produces a decomposition of this compound. 3. Increasing external pH (6-8) brings about a decrease in the steady-state levels of both free and phosphorylated sugar in slices. On the other hand, increasing pH activates the phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-D-galactose by a crude kinase in a tissue extract. 4. Sugar phosphate accumulated in the cells is dephosphorylated by the action of a Zn2+ -activated phosphatase. 5. The efflux of 2-deoxy-D-galactose from the cells is rather slow compared with that found for D-galactose. The efflux is associated with some dephosphorylation of cellular sugar phosphate, and some loss of 2-deoxy-galactose phosphate into the wash-out medium takes place. 6. An inhibition analysis of the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-galactose by the slices indicates that the transport site is shared by D-galactose. The following points of interaction between the sugar molecule and the carrier are identified: C1-OH, C3-OH and C4-OH (both axial) and C6-OH. A (pyranose) ring structure is also essential. A close packing between the substrate and the carrier in the vicinity of C2 is indicated. 7. The data suggest that the above transport system is localized predominantly at the antiluminal (basolateral) face of the renal tubular cells. While the detailed mechanism of the actual transport step (i.e. active transport of the free sugar, or by the action of a phosphotransferase) is still unclear, the data present evidence that both galactokinase and a Zn2+ -activated phosphatase participate in the maintenance of an intracellular steady state of the transported sugar.", "pmid": "10999", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001693 D003837 D005690 D006600 D006863 D066298 D007672 D007700 D011817 D013329", "score": 23.898594, "rank": 1210, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Concentrations of dexamethasone that do not induce tyrosine aminotransferase fail to support Bt2cAMP induction, removal of the steroid from the medium leads to a loss of the Bt2cAMP effect, and an HTC cell line whose aminotransferase is not steroid-inducible does not respond to the cyclic nucleotide. We show that the further induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by Bt2cAMP in dexamethasone-treated cells is due to an increased rate of enzyme synthesis. The cyclic nucleotide has no effect on aminotransferase synthesis in cells grown in the absence of steroid. Several lines of evidence suggest that dexamethasone acts at a step beyond the activation of protein kinase by cAMP: (a) basal levels of cAMP are not altered by growth of HTC cells in dexamethasone; (b) accumulation of cAMP from the medium is not enhanced; (c) the glucocorticoid does not induce cAMP-dependent protein kinase in HTC cells; and (d) there is no augmentation of cAMP binding to the regulatory protein, nor is there any change in cAMP activation of protein kinase caused by growth in dexamethasone.

The effect of varying the [K+] or [HCO-3] of the 133Xe-containing solution on local hypothalamic blood flow has been investigated. 2. There was an increase in local hypothalamic blood flow if the 133Xe-containing solution was HCO3--free; raising the [HCO--3,] of the solution to 40 mM caused a fall in local blood flow. 3. There was an increase in local hypothalamic blood flow when 133Xe was injectedin a mock cerebrospinal fluid containing 10 or 20 mM-[K+]. There was no significant change in  blood flow if a K+-free or a 40 mM [K+] solution was used. 4. The decrease in hypothalamic blood flow caused by injecting a 40 mM-[HCO3] solution could be reversed by the addition of 20 mM [K+] to the solution. There was no further increase in blood flow if 20 mM-[K+] was added to a HCO3--free solution. 5.

This technology is particularly advantageous for minimally processed and ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. In this study, the potential use of Listex\u2122 P100 combined with high hydrostatic pressure (HPP), to enhance the control of Listeria monocytogenes in food was evaluated. For that, the effect of three pressures (200, 300 or 400\u202fMPa; 5\u202fmin, 10\u202f\u00b0C) on phage P100 stability was tested when inoculated in six different matrices: phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4); apple juice (pH 3.41); orange/carrot nectar (pH 3.54); UHT whole milk (pH 6.73); and, two traditional Portuguese fermented products, \"Serra da Estrela\" cheese (pH 5.66) and \"Alheira\", a meat sausage (pH 6.07). The results showed that treatment at 400\u202fMPa reduced phage titres to below the detection level in all matrices, whereas at milder pressures the survival of the phage was matrix dependent. \"Alheira\", \"Serra da Estrela\" cheese and UHT whole milk were shown to be baroprotective matrices that support phage P100 application in HHP up to 300\u202fMPa; however, an accentuated phage inactivation was observed in apple and orange/carrot nectar, which may be related to the acidic pH values of these matrices. The initial phage load did not affect the inactivation rate during HHP processing (300\u202fMPa, 5\u202fmin, 10\u202f\u00b0C) in PBS, cheese, sausage or milk matrices, and the phage titres were stable in these matrices during storage at 4\u202f\u00b0C for 28 days for milk and 60 days for \"Alheira\" and \"Serra da Estrela\" cheese. In addition, a baroprotective effect on phage stability was observed when PBS was supplemented with reducing sugars, dextrin, casein, and tween 80.

The properties of S-adenosyl-L-methionine accumulating system for both vacuoles and spheroplasts are described. Yeast vacuoles were obtained by a modified metabolic lysis procedure from spheroplasts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 2. Isolated vacuoles accumulate S-adenosyl-L-methionine by means of a highly specific transport system as indicated by competition experiments with structural analogs of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The S-adenosyl-L-methionine transport system shows saturation kinetics with an apparent Km of 68 muM in vacuoles and 11 muM in spheroplasts. 3. S-Adenosyl-L-methionine accumulation into vacuoles does not require glucose, phosphoenolpyruvic acid, ATP, ADP nor any other tri- or di-phosphorylated nucleotides. It is insensitive to azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol which strongly inhibit the glucose-dependent accumulation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in spheroplasts. 4. The transport of S-adenosyl-L-methionine into vacuoles is optimal at pH 7.4 and is insensitive to nystatin while the uptake of S-adenosyl-L-methionine into spheroplasts is optimal at pH 5.0 and is strongly sensitive to nystatin. On this basis it has thus been possible to measure both the intracytoplasmic and the intravacuolar pool of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. 5.

One-hour pretreatment with DZP (150 mg/kg i.p. or 10 mg/kg i.v.) markedly suppressed the rates as well as the cumulative amounts of radioactivity excreted in bile after administration of 14C-DPH (70, 35 or 10 mg/kg i.v.). No changes in bile flow were apparent and the decreases in biliary excretion were not accompanied by increases in the urinary elimination of the drug or its metabolites. Disappearance of DPH from plasma and tissue were also reduced, and at 4 and 6 hours after DPH administration higher plasma and tissue concentrations were encountered in the DZP-treated group. The possible mechanisms by which DZP pretreatment altered the biliary excretion and the tissue distribution of DPH were examined; studies in vitro were correlated with the in vivo findings. DPH hepatic uptake and storage were apparently unaffected by DZP treatment, but liver/bile concentration ratios were suppressed. However, a direct competition between the two drugs for biliary transport was not evident. Further studies showed that liver microsomes from rats treated with DZP metabolized DPH in vitro less effectively than those from control rats. The metabolism of DPH was more markedly inhibited by the direct addition of DZP to the incubation mixtures in concentrations greater than 0.05 mM. Therefore, it appears that the effect of DZP on the metabolism of DPH is responsible for most of the observed effect although other mechanisms, including a direct effect on hepatocyte function, cannot be completely ruled out.", "pmid": "850136", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001646 D001798 D003864 D003975 D066298 D007274 D007275 D007700 D008099 D008297 D010672 D011485 D051381 D013997", "score": 21.922272, "rank": 1629, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Kinetic studies of the proteolytic activation of (125)I-labeled human Hageman factor by human plasma kallikrein, plasma, activated Factor XI, and trypsin were performed in the presence and absence of high molecular weight kininogen and surface materials such as celite, kaolin, or ellagic acid. The results showed that surface-bound Hageman factor was 500 times more susceptible than soluble Hageman factor to proteolytic activation by kallikrein in the presence of high molecular weight kininogen. Surface binding of Hageman factor enhanced its cleavage by plasmin, activated Factor XI, and trypsin by 100-fold, 30-fold, and 5-fold, respectively. On a molar basis, trypsin was twice as potent as kallikrein in the cleavage of the surface-bound Hageman factor, while plasmin and activated Factor XI were an order of magnitude less potent than kallikrein. Kallikrein even at concentrations as low as 0.5 nM (i.e., 1/1000th of the concentration of prekallikrein in plasma) was very potent in the limited proteolysis of the surface-bound Hageman factor.

Cells were also grown under identical conditions and homogenized in 0.25 M sucrose in order to allow comparison of some of the intracellular lysosomal hydrolases with their secreted counterparts. Two lysosomal populations were resolved by sucrose density gradient sedimentation, a heavy lysosomal fraction, contered at a density of about 1.25 gm/cm3, and a light lysosomal fraction, centered at a density of about 1.16 gm/cm3. These two populations differed in that the light lysosomes did not appear to contain significant amounts of beta-fucosidase, beta-galactosidase, or acid protease, whereas all six of the hydrolase activities studied were present in the heavy lysosomes.

The folate transport from mucosal to serosal compartment was inhibited by about 55% in irradiated rat at the pH of the intestinal chyme (6.5).

The maximum folate transport which occurred at pH 4.0 was not adversely affected by whole body irradiation. An acidic, pH dependent, passive uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid was observed.4. The normal absorption barrier of the small bowel was not disrupted by the acidification process as practically no uptake was observed with irradiated segments pretreated at pH 4.0 except in the presence of ATP.5. Leucine and serine transport at a zero concentration gradient indicated active transport mechanisms which were not affected by acidification. Their uptake was additively increased in the presence of glucose and ATP, further indicating that the normal physiology of the intestines was not affected by the acidification process.6. An intestinal mucosal cell surface ATPase was observed which was Mg(2+) dependent. It could hydrolyse solution phase ATP and thus generate the protons necessary for the acidification of a microenvironment where passive uptake of the neutral folate species could occur.7. The ATPase activity was inhibited about 90% by 50 mM-Na azide at pH 6.5. Below this concentration folate transport was also inhibited.8. Na azide did not inhibit folate transport at pH 4.0, suggesting that its inhibition of folate uptake at pH 6.5 is related to its inhibitory effect on ATPase, rather than on folate transport per se.

Cardiolipin alone was more effective than any of the detergents tested in stimulating enzyme activity. The pH optimum for the reaction varied with the nature of the dispersing agent. With sodium taurocholate, Triton CF-54 and cardiolipin, the pH optima were 6.2, 5.9, and 5.6, respectively. The enzyme had a nearly absolute requirement for Mn2+, with maximum activity being attained at a concentration of 15 mM Mn2+. Other divalent or trivalent cations were either less effective than Mn2+ or inhibited the transferase reaction. The Km values calculated for UDP-Gal and GM2 were 1.1 X 10(-4) M and 9.9 X 10(-5) M, respectively. The enzyme could not be dissociated from Golgi apparatus fractions by treatment with ultrasound, indicating that it is tightly associated with the membrane and not part of the luminal contents. The newly synthesized GM2, the product of the reaction, was incorporated into or became tightly associated with the membranes of the Golgi apparatus.", "pmid": "5567", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001923 D002308 D002855 D003902 D004789 D005700 D005732 D006056 D006863 D007700 D008099 D008297 D008345 D051381 D013347", "score": 23.476233, "rank": 1290, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Evidence for a critical glutamyl and an aspartyl residue in the function of pig heart diphosphopyridine nucleotide dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.", "abstract": "The pH dependence of the maximum velocity of the reaction catalyzed by diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN) dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase indicates the requirement for the basic form of an ionizable group in the enzyme-substrate complex with a pK of 6.6. This pK is unaltered from 10 to 33 degrees C, suggesting the ionization of a carboxyl rather than an imidazolium ion. The enzyme is inactivated upon incubation with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide in the presence of glycinamide or glycine ethyl ester. This inactivation is dependent on pH and the rate constant (k) increases as the pH is decreased in the range 7.3 to 6.25. A plot of 1/(H+) vs. 1/k suggests that the enzyme is inactivated as a result of the modification of a single ionizable group in this pH range. The coenzyme DPN and substrate alpha-ketoglutarate do not affect the rate of inactivation. In contrast, manganous ion (2 mM) and isocitrate (60 mM) produce a sevenfold decrease in the rate constant. The allosteric activator ADP (1 mM) does not itself influence the rate of inactivation; however, it reduces the concentration of Mn2+ (1 mM) and isocitrate (20 mM) required to produce the same decrease in the inactivation constant. These observations imply that the modification occurs at the substrate-binding site. Experiments employing [1-14C]glycine ethyl ester show a net incorporation of 2 mol of glycine ethyl ester per subunit (40 000), concomitant with the complete inactivation of the enzyme. The radioactive modified enzyme, after removal of excess reagent by dialysis, was exhaustively digested with proteolytic enzymes. High voltage electrophoretic analyses of the hydrolysate at pH 6.4 and 3.5 yield two major radioactive spots with approximately equal intensity, which correspond to gamma-glutamylglycine and beta-aspartylglycine, the ultimate products of reaction with glutamic and aspartic acids, respectively. Modification in the presence of manganous ion and isocitrate results in significant reduction in the incorporation of radioactivity into the two dipeptides. These results suggest that carbodiimide attacks one glutamyl and one aspartyl residue per subunit of the enzyme and that the integrity of these residues is crucial for the enzymatic activity.", "pmid": "15585", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001224 D001665 D005971 D006863 D007521 D007523 D007700 D009206 D009243 D011485 D013552 D013696", "score": 20.037071, "rank": 2229, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The rates of the Na+-dependent exchange reaction in the steady state were measured in a solution containing 45 micronM free Mg2+, 100 mMNaCl, 80 micronM ATP, and 160 micronM ADP at pH 6.5 and 4-5 degrees. The rate and amount of decrease in phosphorylated intermediate on adding ADP, i.e., the amount of ADP-sensitive EP, were measured while varying one of the reaction parameters and fixing the others mentioned above. Plots of the exchange rate and the amount of ADP-sensitive EP against the logarithm of free Mg2+ concentration gave bell-shaped curves with maximum values at 50-60 micronM free Mg2+. Plots of the exchange rate and the amount of ADP-sensitive EP against pH also gave bell-shaped curves with maximum values at pH 6.9-7. They both increased with increase in the concentration of NaCl to maximum values at 150-200 mM NaCl, and then decreased rapidly with increase in the NaCl concentration above 200 mM. The dependences of the exchange rate and the amount of ADP-sensitive EP on the concentration of ADP followed the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the Michaelis constants Km, for both were 43 micronM. The dependence of the exchange rate on the ATP concentration also followed the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the Km value was 30 micronM. The amount of ADP-sensitive EP increased with increase in the ATP concentration, and reached a maximum value at about 5 micronM ATP. 2. The N+-dependent [3H]ADP-ATP exchange reaction was started by adding [3H]ADP to EP at low Mg2+-concentration. The reaction consisted of a rapid initial phase and a slow steady phase. The amount of [3H]ATP formed during the rapid initial phase, i.e. the size of the ATP burst, was equal to that of ADP-sensitive EP, and was proportional to the rate in the steady state. At high Mg2+ concentration, the rate of Na+-dependent exchange in the steady state was almost zero, and EP did not show any ADP sensitivity. However, rapid formation of [3H]ATP was observed in the pre-steady state, and the size of the ATP burst increased with increase in the KCl concentration. From these findings, we concluded that an enzyme-ATP complex (E2ATP) formed at low Mg2+ concentration is in equilibrium with EP + ADP, that the rate-limiting step for the exchange reaction is the release of ATP from the enzyme-ATP complex, that the ADP-insensitive EP (formula: see text) produced at high Mg2+ concentration is in equilibrium with the enzyme-ATP complex, and that the equilibrium shifts towards the enzyme-ATP complex on adding KCl. Actually, the ratio of the size of the ATP burst to the amount of EP was equal to the reciprocal of the equilibrium constant of step (formula: see text), determined by a method previously reported by us.", "pmid": "14933", "mesh_set": "D000244 D000251 D000255 D000818 D001921 D002417 D006863 D007700 D008274 D008956 D009994 D010710 D011188 D011485 D012964", "score": 25.523064, "rank": 948, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Mean plasma levels for nitrazepam recipients are indistinguishable from those for patients receiving no night sedation. The mean plasma levels for a group of patients receiving sodium amylobarbitone were significantly reduced.

While acetylcholine (0.5 mug/kg X min) was infused intraarterially on one side, the opposite side was taken as control. 4 minutes after the start of the infusion non-radioactive microspheres of 15 mum diameter were injected into the ascending aorta. Subsequently the muscles were freeze-sectioned into 1.0 mm thick slices and cleared by sodium hydroxide and glycerine. The concentration of microspheres per mm3 was measured in representative cross sections of the muscle. Higher concentrations of microspheres were observed in the proximal than in the distal slices of the acetylcholine-treated side. The distribution of microspheres was found to be different in the segments as well: higher values were found in the central than in peripheral segments. The untreated side showed a qualitatively similar state. The differences in the distribution pattern, however, were smaller than in the acetylcholine-treated muscles.

These effects were not blocked by alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists or by propranolol, though the latter blocked inhibitory effects of isoprenaline on both segments. Inhibitory responses to tyramine persisted in urethral segments treated with cocaine and in urethral segments taken from reserpine-treated rats, and thus tyramine may have some direct action.

These DNA preparations were characterized by sensitivity to a single strand specific nuclease, CsSO4/AgClO4 buoyant density, sedimentation in neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients, and sedimentation in neutral sucrose gradients after digestion with S1-nuclease. The DNA from 4-h stimulated cultures has an increased amount of single strandedness as indicated by sensitivity to S1-nuclease and buoyant density. The amount of single strandedness increases as the cells enter S-phase and decreases as they enter the G2 period. The DNA isolated from G0 cells behaves as native, duplex DNA with virtually no breaks. The DNA from 2-h and 4-h stimulated cultures contained a significant number of breaks. The number of breaks increases to a maximum in S-phase and declines as the cells enter the G2 period. There are no nuclease-sensitive sites (gaps) in G0 or 2-h cultures. The number of sites increases 4 h after stimulation, reaches a maximum during S-phase, and decreases as the cells enter G2.

No deamination of the cytosine nucleus was noted during this treatment. Native and denatured DNA samples from calf thymus were treated in 3H2O with cysteine methyl ester at pH 5 and 37 degrees C for 24 h and incorporation of tritium into each DNA base was determined by enzymic digestion of the treated DNA. The order of the specific radioactivity found was cytosine greater than guanine greater than adenine greater than thymine for denatured DNA and guanine greater than adenine approximately cytosine greater than thymine for native DNA. The ratio of radioactivity for denatured/native was 11.6 for cytosine, 1.5 for guanine, 1.8 for adenine and 1.1 for thymine. Hence the incorporation in cytosine under the reaction conditions is preferential for single-stranded, nonhelical regions of DNA. Escherichia coli glutamic acid tRNA II was treated in 3H2O with 1.24 M cysteine methyl ester at pH 5 and 37 degrees C. The 24-h-treated tRNA was digested with ribonuclease T1 and the fragments were fractionated. Each fragment was then digested with ribonuclease T2 into mononucleotides and the radioactivity distribution among the bases was determined. The average radioactivity found for each of the bases of the four major nucleotides was cytosine greater than guanine approximately adenine greater than uracil. The radioactivity in cytosine varied greatly among the RNase T1 fragments, the ratio of the highest to the lowest radioactivity being 18.7.

The enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of a wide variety of phosphomonoesters, but not that of bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate or adenosine 5'-triphosphate. 2.

Specific binding constitutes more than 90% of total binding at 0 degrees and less than 10% of total binding at 37 degrees. Arrhenius plots suggest a sharp conformational change in the diazepam receptor near 18 degrees. Mitochondrial fractions from rat kidney, liver, and lung exhibit some [3H]diazepam binding that can be displaced by nonradioactive diazepam and several other benzodiazepines. However, Ro-4864, which is almost inactive in displacing [3H]diazepam from brain membranes, is extremely potent in displacing it from kidney mitochondria. Conversely, clonazepam, the most potent inhibitor of brain binding, is an extremely weak inhibitor of kidney binding. Furthermore, diazepam binding to kidney mitochondria has an affinity constantof 40 nM, about 15 times higher than that in brain. No specific diazepam binding was detected in intestine or skeletal muscle. Thus, specific [3H]diazepam binding to membranes appears to be restricted to brain, where it is unevenly distributed: the density of diazepam receptors is about five times higher in cortex (the highest density) than in pons-meddula (lowest density).

{"title": "The maladaptive renal response to secondary hypocapnia during chronic HCl acidosis in the dog.", "abstract": "It has generally been thought that homeostatic mechanisms of renal origin are responsible for minimizing the alkalemia produced by chronic hypocapnia. Recent observations from this laboratory have demonstrated, however, that the decrement in [HCO(-) (3)], which \"protects\" extracellular pH in normal dogs, is simply the by-product of a nonspecific effect of Paco(2) on renal hydrogen ion secretion; chronic primary hypocapnia produces virtually the same decrement in plasma [HCO(-) (3)] in dogs with chronic HCl acidosis as in normal dogs (Delta[HCO(-) (3)]/DeltaPaco(2) = 0.5), with the result that plasma [H(+)] in animals with severe acidosis rises rather than falls during superimposed forced hyperventilation. This observation raised the possibility that the secondary hypocapnia which normally accompanies metabolic acidosis, if persistent, might induce an analogous renal response and thereby contribute to the steady-state decrement in plasma [HCO(-) (3)] observed during HCl feeding. We reasoned that if sustained secondary hypocapnia provoked the kidney to depress renal bicarbonate reabsorption, the acute salutary effect of hypocapnia on plasma acidity might be seriously undermined. To isolate the possible effects of secondary hypocapnia from those of the hydrogen ion load, per se, animals were maintained in an atmosphere of 2.6% CO(2) during an initial 8-day period of acid feeding (7 mmol/kg per day); this maneuver allowed Paco(2) to be held constant at the control level of 36 mm Hg despite the hyperventilation induced by the acidemia. Steady-state bicarbonate concentration during the period of eucapnia fell from 20.8 to 16.0 meq/liter, while [H(+)] rose from 42 to 55 neq/liter. During the second phase of the study, acid feeding was continued but CO(2) was removed from the inspired air, permitting Paco(2) to fall by 6 mm Hg. In response to this secondary hypocapnia, bicarbonate concentration fell by an additional 3.0 meq/liter to a new steady-state level of 13.0 meq/liter. This reduction in bicarbonate was of sufficient magnitude to more than offset the acute salutary effect of the hypocapnia on plasma hydrogen ion concentration; in fact, steady-state [H(+)] rose as a function of the adaptive fall in Paco(2), Delta[H(+)]/Delta Paco(2) = -0.44. That the fall in bicarbonate observed in response to chronic secondary hypocapnia was the result of the change in Paco(2) was confirmed by the observation that plasma bicarbonate returned to its eucapnic level in a subgroup of animals re-exposed to 2.6% CO(2). These data indicate that the decrement in plasma [HCO(-) (3)] seen in chronic HCl acidosis is a composite function of (a) the acid load itself and (b) the renal response to the associated hyperventilation. We conclude that this renal response is maladaptive because it clearly diminishes the degree to which plasma acidity is protected by secondary hypocapnia acutely. Moreover, under some circumstances, this maladaptation actually results in more severe acidemia than would occur in the complete absence of secondary hypocapnia.", "pmid": "21198", "mesh_set": "D000138 D000208 D000818 D001639 D002245 D002908 D004285 D004305 D005260 D006706 D006851 D006863 D007668", "score": 16.549631, "rank": 3800, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The endogenous folates in orange juice were identified as mainly 5-methyl reduced derivatives of pteroylpolyglutamates (40-45% pentaglutamate, 10-15% tetraglutamate, 30-40% monoglutamate, and the rest were tri-and diglutamates).

Neutralization of 12 g citric acid to pH 6.4 largely reverses the inhibitory effect. On the other hand, the availability of pteroylmonoglutamate (PteGlu) is not influenced by a supplement of orange juice or citric acid.

A gradation in steady-state cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) levels was observed in incubated slices of these tissues (inner medula greater than outer medulla greater than cortex). This correlated with the proportion of total guanyl cyclase activity in the 100 000 g particulate fraction of each tissue, but was discordant with the relative activities of guanylate cyclase (highest in cortex) and of cGMP-phosphodiesterase (lowest in cortex) in whole tissue homogenates. Soluble guanylate cyclase of cortex and inner medulla exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km for MnGTP of 0.11 mM, while the particulate enzyme from inner medulla exhibited apparent positive cooperative behavior and a decreased dependence on Mn2+. Thus, the particulate enzyme could play a key role in regulating cGMP levels inthe intact cell where Mn2+ concentrations are low. The soluble and particulate enzymes from inner medulla were further distinguished by their responses to several test agents. The soluble enzyme was activated by Ca2+, NaN3, NaNo2 and phenylhydrazine, whereas particulate activity was inhibited by Ca2+ and was unresponsive to the latter agents. In the presence of NaNo2, Mn2+ requirement of the soluble enzyme was reduced and equivalent to that of the particulate preparation. Moreover, relative responsiveness of the sollble enzyme to NaNO2 was potentiated when Mg2+ replaced Mn2+ as the sole divalent cation. These changes in metal requirements may be involved in the action of NaNO2 to increase cGMP in intact kidney.

Depolarizing current pulses did not elicit an action potential. Cells displayed a linear current-voltage relationship when artificially depolarized up to +30 mV. Iontophoretically applied dopamine elicited a depolarizing response with a conductance increase and a reversal potential of -15 mV (S.D.=+/-4.7).

After reaction with TCEA the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen was strongly increased and the heme-heme interaction strongly diminished. The Bohr effect and the effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate on oxygen affinity remained unchanged. The effect of TCEA on the properties of hemoglobin points to specificity in its reaction with functional groups of hemoglobin.", "pmid": "13312", "mesh_set": "D001665 D004163 D004586 D006454 D006801 D006863 D066298 D008626 D009588 D010108 D011485 D011487", "score": 16.124277, "rank": 4026, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Internal carotid blood flow (ICBF) was measured at normal CSFP and at hydrostatically maintained 50 mm Hg CSFP.

The overall general picture was characterized by progressive degeneration of Leydig cells, cells of the germinal series and Sertoli cells. Concomitantly, there was increasing thickening and fibrosis of the tubular walls. Cytoplasmic focal accumulations of glycogen, increasing with the duration of the disease, were conspicuous in many spermatogonia. All of these alterations are nonspecific and are attributable to adverse endocrine effects introduced by the oestrogen-secreting tumour.

Biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase.

{"title": "Effects on the diet on brain neurotransmitters.", "abstract": "The synthesis of neurotransmitters in mammalian brain responds rapidly to changes in precursor availability. Serotonin synthesis depends largely on the brain concentrations of L-tryptophan, its precursor amino aicd. This relationship appears to be physiologic: when brain tryptophan levels vary because of insulin secretion or meal ingestion, corresponding alterations occur in the rate of serotonin formation. The ability of any food to modify brain tryptophan (and serotonin) depends on how its ingestion changes the serum concentration of not only tryptophan, but also several other large neutral amino acids that compete with tryptophan for uptake into the brain. Such precursor-induced changes in brain serotonin appear to be functionally important: animals having a reduced level of brain serotonin (caused by the chronic ingestion of a naturally tryptophan-poor diet, such as corn) demonstrate a heightened sensitivity to painful stimuli; this pain sensitivity can be acutely restored to normal values by a single injection of L-tryptophan, which rapidly elevates brain serotonin. The synthesis of catecholamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine) in the brain also varies with the availability of the precursor amino acid L-tyrosine. Single injections of this amino acid increase brain tyrosine levels and accelerate brain catechol synthesis, while injections of a competing neutral amino acid (e.g., leucine, tryptophan) reduce brain tyrosine and its rate of conversion to dopa. The rate of catecholamine synthesis, however, appears to be influenced less by precursor levels than is serotonin formation: tyrosine hydroxylase, whcih catalyzes the rate-limiting step in catecholamine synthesis, responds strongly to end-product inhibition and to other controls that reflect variations in neuronal activity. The synthesis of acetylcholine in brain responds to substrate (choline) availability much like serotonin synthesis. Short-term alterations in brain choline levels are mirrored by similar changes in brain acetylcholine concentration. Variations in the daily dietary intake of choline also modify brain choline and acetylcholine. The relationship between choline availability and acetylchyoline synthesis has already foudn a cletween choline availability and acetylchyoline synthesis has already found a clinical application: choline has been used successfully in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, a disorder of the central nervous system thought to reflect a deficiency in cholinergic transmission.

Histamine (9 X 10(-5) M) decreased antral luminal acid loss which could not be accounted for by active H+ secretion or appearance of organic acid.

Histamine, theophylline, and N(6),O(2)-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate did not significantly alter secretion by fundus in the presence of salicylate (5 X 10(-3)M). However, after removal of salicylate, these agents stimulated acid secretion. Histamine decreased luminal acid loss by both antrum and fundus treated with salicylate, increased the electrical resistance of these tissues, and decreased Jls erythritol of fundic mucosa. Burimamide (1 X 10(-3) M) inhibited the permeability effects of histamine on antrum and fundus. The data indicate that histamine decreases spontaneous antral mucosal permeability as well as salicylate-induced increase in mucosal permeability of both antrum and fundus.

The final product was hrophoresis in the presence and absence of dodecyl sulfate. A molecular weight of 162,000 +/- 5000 was determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis in good agreement with the value of 160,000 estimated by gel electrophoresis, but a low-sedimentation constant of 6.5 S suggests that the enzyme is asymmetric. The molecule appears to be made up of a single polypeptide chain with no evidence for multiple repeating sequences: it could not be dissociated into smaller fragments by dodecyl sulfate even after complete carboxymethylation; tryptic cleavage of the native protein yielded only two fragments of molecular weight 20,000 and 140,000 without loss of enzymatic activity.

As a potential neurotoxicant, PQ adversely affects neurogenesis and inhibits proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). However, the molecular mechanistic insights of PQ exposure on NPCs remains to be determined. Herein, we determine the extent to which Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling involved in the inhibition effect of PQ on mouse NPCs from subventricular zone (SVZ). NPCs were treated with different concentrations of PQ (40, 80, and 120\u202f\u03bcM). PQ exposure provoked oxidative stress and apoptosis and PQ inhibited cell viability and proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Significantly, PQ exposure altered the expression/protein levels of the Wnt pathway genes in NPCs. In addition, PQ reduced cellular \u03b2-catenin, p-GSK-3\u03b2, and cyclin-D1 and increased the radio of Bax/Bcl2. Further, Wnt pathway activation by treatment with LiCl and Wnt1 attenuated PQ-induced inhibition of mNPCs proliferation. Antioxidant (NAC) treatment alleviated the inhibition of PQ-induced Wnt signaling pathway. Overall, our results suggest significant inhibitory effects of PQ on NPCs proliferation via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

In its kinetic properties, this enzyme resembled the 1-PFK's from other bacteria. With the substrates fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed, the Km for one substrate being unaffected by a variation in the concentration of the other substrate. At pH 8.0, the Km values for F-1-P and ATP were 1.64 X 10(-4) M and 4.08 X 10(-4) M, respectively. At fixed concentrations of F-1-P and ATP, an increase in the Mg2+ resulted in sigmoidal kinetics. Activity was inhibited by ATP when the ratio of ATP:Mg2+ was greater than 0.5 suggesting that ATP:2 Mg2+ was the substrate and free ATP was inhibitory. Activity of 1-PFK was stimulated by K+ and to a lesser extent by NH4+ and Na+.

Thirty-two cells located in the nucleus Z of the cat medulla oblongata and activated by spinal fibres in the dorsolateral fascicle were selected for the study. 3. Extracellular recording from these neurones demonstrated that most of them were monosynaptically linked to spinal fibres excited by ipsilateral hind limb group I muscle afferents.

{"title": "Cortical evoked potential and extracellular K+ and H+ at critical levels of brain ischemia.", "abstract": "As shown previously, the electrical function of the brain is critically dependent on cerebral blood flow in the sense that reduction beyond an ischemic threshold of approximately 15 ml/100 gm per minute (approximately 35% of control) in the baboon leads to complete failure of the somatosensory evoked response. This study tests the hypothesis that electrical failure in ischemia may be directly associated with a massive release of intracellular K+ or with a critical degree of extracellular acidosis. By microelectrode techniques, measurements of blood flow, extracellular activity of K+ and H+ as well as evoked potential were made in the baboon neocortex. Reductions in blood flow were obtained by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and depression beyond the ischemic threshold of electrical function achieved by a reduction of systemic blood pressure which, in the ischemic zones, changed local cerebral blood flow proportionally. Abolition of evoked response could not be explained by depolarization by release of intracellular K+, nor was it critically dependent on cortical pH. However, the massive release of intracellular K+ was by itself critically dependent on cortical blood flow and occurred at 18 greater than 6 greater than 2 ml/100 gm per minute (median with 5% confidence limits). Thus a dual threshold in ischemia for neuronal function is described, the threshold for release of K+ being clearly lower than the threshold for complete electrical failure. Further, the findings support the concept of an ischemic penumbra during which the neurons remain structurally intact but functionally inactive. That neurons can survive for some time in this state of lethargy is evidenced by the observations that an increase in rCBF, if sufficient, can restore evoked potential and normalize extracellular K+ activity as well as pH.", "pmid": "13521", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001794 D001921 D001923 D002560 D004195 D004562 D005071 D005110 D005260 D006863 D002546 D008297 D010215 D011188", "score": 21.262117, "rank": 1831, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

INDO (5 mg/kg) was infused IV prior to MI, and the results were compared to vehicle-treated and sham-operated dogs. INDO induced a slight hypertension after MI. Additionally, INDO attenuated the decline in coronary blood flow in the non-ischemic myocardium after MI. Myocardial lysosomes (biopsied three hours post-MI) were more labile in ischemic than in nonischemic tissue, and INDO had a stabilizing effect on lysosomes from ischemic tissue. Plasma activity of cathepsin was increased following MI, and INDO attenuated this increase. In the myocardium (biopsies three hours post-MI) prostaglandin A + E levels were suppressed 60% in both ischemic and nonischemic tissue with INDO treatment; prostaglandin F2 alpha levels were lower with INDO treatment but not significantly so.

When these hybrids were grown in medium containing alpha-amanitin, the sensitive form of polymerase II was inactivated, and the activity resistant to alpha-amanitin increased proportionally. The total polymerase II activity level therefore remained constant. This regulation of RNA polymerase II activity occurred independently of that of RNA polymerase I and was similar to that observed previously in the alpha-amanitin-resistant rat myoblast mutant clone Ama102 (Somers, Pearson, and Ingles, 1975a). A sensitive radioimmunoassay was developed to quantitate the total mass of RNA polymerase II enzyme. Under conditions of regulation of the enzymatic activity when hybrids grown in alpha-amanitin exhibited a 2-3 fold increase in the activity of the alpha-amanitin-resistant enzyme, no major change in the enzyme mass was detected immunologically. However, quantitation of the alpha-amanitin-inactivated polymerase II of wild-type sensitivity by 3H-amanitin binding indicated that the loss of its enzymic activity was accompanied by a loss of 3H-amanitin binding capacity in the cell lysates.

However, several challenges, including the lack of effective host target genes and the off-target effects, limit the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in insects. To mitigate these difficulties, we established a highly efficient virus-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in transgenic silkworms. This system includes the baculovirus-inducible promoter 39K, which directs transcription of the gene encoding, the Cas9 protein, and the U6 promoter which targets the sgATAD3A site of the ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3 (ATAD3A) gene. The double-positive transgenic line sgATAD3A\u00d739K-Cas9 (ATAD3A-KO) was obtained by hybridization; antiviral activity in this hybrid transgenic line is induced only after Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. The BmNPV-inducible system significantly reduced off-target effects and did not affect the economically important characteristics of the transgenic silkworms. Most importantly, this novel system efficiently and consistently edited target genes, inhibiting BmNPV replication after the transgenic silkworms were inoculated with occlusion bodies (OBs). The suppression of BmNPV by the virus-inducible system was comparable to that of the stably expressed CRISPR/Cas9 system. Therefore, we successfully established a highly efficient BmNPV-inducible ATAD3A-KO transgenic silkworm line, with improved gene targeting specificity and antiviral efficiency.

Stopped-flow pH electrode measurements.", "abstract": "A pH-sensitive glass electrode was used in a temperature-controlled stopped-flow rapid reaction apparatus to determine rates of pH equilibration in red cell suspensions. The apparatus requires less than 2 ml of reactants. The electrode is insensitive to pressure and flow variations, and has a response time of < 5 ms. A 20% suspension of washed fresh human erythrocytes in saline at pH 7.7 containing NaHCO(3) and extracellular carbonic anhydrase is mixed with an equal volume of 30 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.7. Within a few milliseconds after mixing, extracellular HCO(3) (-) reacts with H(+) to form CO(2), which enters the red cells and rehydrates to form HCO(3) (-), producing an electrochemical potential gradient for HCO(3) (-) from inside to outside the cells. HCO(3) (-) then leaves the cells in exchange for Cl(-), and extracellular pH increases as the HCO(3) (-) flowing out of the cells reacts with H(+). Flux of HCO(3) (-) is calculated from the dpH/dt during HCO(3) (-)-Cl(-) exchange, and a velocity constant is computed from the flux and the calculated intracellular and extracellular [HCO(3) (-)]. The activation energy for the exchange process is 18.6 kcal/mol between 5 degrees C and 17 degrees C (transition temperature), and 11.4 kcal/mol from 17 degrees C to 40 degrees C. The activation energies and transition temperature are not significantly altered in the presence of a potent anion exchange inhibitor (SITS), although the fluxes are markedly decreased.

Of the substituted aminocyclopentane carboxylic acids, that compound with a separation of amino and carboxylic acid groups closest to that of the extended GABA molecule (4.74 A) had a potency similar to GABA. As the separation decreased the hyperpolarizing activity fell off rapidly. The substituted aminocyclohexane carboxylic acids were generally inactive even at a concentration of 10 mM. 3 Strychnine blocked the motoneurone hyperpolarizing responses to all compounds with a distance between the amino and carboxylic acid groups of 3.66 A or less, but did not block the response of compounds with a distance of 4.08 A or greater.  Picrotoxin and bicuculline antagonized all the responses to varying degrees and therefore were of little value in characterizing the responses. 4 On the primary afferents GABA was the most potent aliphatic amino acid and glycine the least potent. The substituted aminocyclohexane carboxylic acids were generally inactive on primary afferents. The response of the substituted aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid whose separation of amino and carboxylic acid groups was closest to that of the extended GABA molecule was most similar to the GABA response. However, (+/-)-cis-3-aminocyclopentane-carboxylic acid (separation=4.08 A),which mimicked the action of GABA on motoneurones, closely mimicked the depolarizing action of beta-alanine on primary afferents. 5 The findings suggest that the hyperpolarizing GABA receptor on motoneurones will accept a molecule whose amino and carboxylic acid groups are separated by a distance of 4.08 A or greater while the glycine receptor will accept a compound with a distance of 3.66 A or less. The depolarizing GABA receptors on primary afferents appear to be more selective since they are not activated by (+/-)-cis-3-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid (separation = 4.08 A), while the motoneurone receptors are.", "pmid": "837017", "mesh_set": "D000200 D000409 D000596 D000818 D002264 D003509 D005998 D066298 D009046 D009475 D013116 D013126 D013329 D013331 D005680", "score": 31.217978, "rank": 423, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Correlation between activation and dimer formation of rat renal phosphate-dependent glutaminase.", "abstract": "Gel filtration and velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients were used to determine the molecular weights of purified rat renal phosphate-dependent glutaminase. The purified glutaminase has a molecular weight of 160,000 in Tris or barbital buffers and forms dimers of 332,000 molecular weight in the presence of its activator, Pi. The correlation between activation and dimer formation was investigated by determining the sedimentation coefficient at various concentrations of glutaminase activators. Saturation curves for Pi and riboflavin phosphate demonstrate an excellent correlation between per cent activation and increasing S20,w with increasing concentrations of these activators. The concentrations required for half-maximal saturation were 40 to 50 mM for Pi and 10 to 15 mM for riboflavin phosphate. Correlation between activation and dimer formation was also found with other activators at subsaturating concentrations. Moreover, the activation and dimer formation were found to be reversed to a similar extent by increasing concentrations of NaCl. Finally, we studied the effects of Pi and NaCl on the stability of glutaminase activity at 37 degrees. Pi stabilized glutaminase activity by increasing the t1/2 for inactivation from 12 min in the absence of Pi to 242 at 150 mM Pi. The concentration of Pi which gave approximately half-maximal change in t1/2 was 50 mM and addition of NaCl reversed this stabilization. These results support the hypothesis that phosphate-dependent glutaminase is active only as a dimer or larger aggregate. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that binding of Pi changes the monomer conformation sufficiently to produce activation and that this new conformation leads to self-association.", "pmid": "845154", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004789 D005972 D007668 D007700 D046911 D008970 D010710 D051381", "score": 23.741259, "rank": 1240, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The primary change in the ratio of activites was the result of a loss of proline dehydrogenase activity during dialysis. Both activities were eluted in single peaks from diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and Sephadex G-200 columns. They had identical sedimentation coefficients (10.3S), as determined in linear sucrose gradients, and identical isoelectric points (4.95 to 5.12) based on isoelectric focusing. The proline dehydrogenase activity was dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and L-proline, and the PCA reductase required L-PCA and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The optimum pH for the assay of proline dehydrogenase was approximately 10.2, whereas that for PCA reductase was 6.5 to 7.5. An increase in pH from 8.0 to 10.2 greatly decreased the apparent Michaelis constant observed for L-proline, and an increase from pH 8.3 to 8.6 resulted in a large shift in the reaction equilibrium toward PCA. Both the dehydrogenase and reductase activities were stabilized to heating at 65 degrees C for 5 min by solutes of high ionic strength and were inactivated in a similar fashion when dissolved in low-ionic-strength buffer. The specific activities for both were reduced by about 50% when glucose was added to the growth medium.

The efflux of radioactive sodium was measured from squid axons during simultaneous voltage clamp experiments such that it was possible to determine the efflux of sodium associated with a measured voltage clamp current. 2. The extra efflux of sodium associated with voltage clamp pulses increased linearly with the magnitude of the depolarization above 40 mV. A 100 mV pulse of sufficient duration to produce all of the sodium current increased the rate constant of efflux by about 10(-6). 3. Application of 100 nM tetrodotoxin eliminated the sodium current and the extra efflux of radioactive sodium. 4. Cooling the axon increased the extra efflux/voltage clamp pulse slightly with a Q10 of 1/1-1. On the same axons cooling increased the integral of the sodium current with a Q10 of 1/1-4. 5. Replacing external sodium with Tris, dextrose or Mg-mannitol reduced the extra efflux of sodium by about 50%. The inward sodium current was replaced with an outward current as expected. 6. Replacing external sodium with lithium also reduced the extra efflux by about 50% but the currents seen in lithium were slightly larger than those in sodium. 7. The effect of replacing external sodium was not voltage dependent. Cooling reduced the effect so that there was less reduction of efflux on switching to Tris ASW in the cold than in the warm. 8. The extra efflux of sodium into sodium-free ASW is approximately the same as the integral of the sodium current. Adding external sodium produces a deviation from the independence principle such that there is more exchange of sodium than predicted. Such a deviation from prediction was noted by Hodgkin & Huxley (1952c). 9. Using the equations of Hodgkin & Huxley (1952c) modified to include the deviation from independence reported in this paper and its temperature dependence, one can predict the temperature dependence of the sodium efflux associated with action potentials and obtain much better agreement than is possibly without these phenomena. 10. This deviation from independence in the sodium fluxes is the type expected from some kind of mixing and binding of sodium within the membrane phase.", "pmid": "856999", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001369 D001692 D049832 D005947 D066298 D008094 D008353 D008564 D012964 D013696 D013779 D014325", "score": 12.532302, "rank": 5608, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Similar results were obtained using a minimal salts medium, except with pyruvate, which did not support growth. Inhibition of ST synthesis by D-glucose was overcome by the addition of 3 X 10(-3) M cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Glucose repression of beta-galactosidase synthesis under conditions optimal for inhibition of ST synthesis was also reversed by exogenous cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the presence of the inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside.

Its specificity for sphingomyelin as substrate is similar to that of sph'ase 5.0, but it differs from sph'ase 5.0 in its pH optimum (7.4 vs 5.0) and in a requirement for Mg2+ for optimal activity. Other properties of sph'ase 7.4 that distinguish it from sph'ase 5.0 include (a) its lack of appreciable solubilization during dialysis of crude homogenates (b) a more marked concentrations in grey matter than in white matter (9- to 13- fold vs 1.5- to 2-fold for sph'ase 5.0); (c) inhibition by Ca2+ and Cd2+ ions, and by EDTA; (D) stimulation by dithiothreitol, and inhibition by cysteine, N-ethylmaleimide, and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; (e) lack of inhibition by nucleotides (AMP.ADP, and ATP) and by NAD plus NADH; and (f) relative instability to storage or manipulation between -20degrees C and 40degrees C.

The luminal disappearance of each folate was markedly impaired after exposure of the patients to dietary gluten and improved by gluten restriction, but not to within the range found in the normal subjects. The luminal disappearance of each folate was markedly impaired after exposure of the patients to dietary gluten and improved by gluten restriction, but not to within the range found in the normal subjects. In each experiment, column chromatography of the luminal aspirates revealed similar spectra of hydrolytic products of [14C]PG-7, whereas the fraction of the distal aspirate chromatogram appearing as pteroyl-micron[14C]glutamyl-gamma-monoglutamate ([14C]-PG-1) was similar in all three groups. By accounting for the variable effects of absorption on the luminal appearance of [14C]PG-1 and by correcting for mucosal hydrolysis which was not followed by release of [14C]PG-1 to the luminal contents, the calculated rate of in vivo hydrolysis of [14C]PG-7 to [14C]PG-1 was found impaired in both celiac sprue groups, with significant improvement on treatment. In mucosal biopsies from the sprue patients, the in vitro activity of folate conjugase in whole homogenates was higher and the activity of disaccharidase lower than in a group of 12 normal mucosal biopsies. These in vitro data suggest that the predominant cellular location of mucosal folate conjugase is different from that of disaccharidase, whereas comparison with the results of in vivo hydrolysis suggests that measurement of the enzyme in whole mucosal homogenates overestimates its significant digestive activity. The present studies indicate that (a) the mucosal lesion of celiac sprue significantly limits the intestinal absorption of both simple and conjugated folate, and (b) malabsorption of conjugated folate results from a combination of impaired hydrolysis and decreased mucosal uptake of hydrolytic product.", "pmid": "856874", "mesh_set": "D000328 D001706 D002446 D005243 D005260 D005492 D005696 D005971 D005983 D006454 D006801 D007408 D007583 D008055 D008297 D008875 D010477 D013393 D014994 D011623", "score": 15.276566, "rank": 4466, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

It would appear that most, but possibly not all of the newly accumulated [3H]noradrenaline is rapidly bound to some particulate cytoplasmic constituent within the synaptosome. [3H]Dopamine and [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine were also rapidly bound within synaptosomes but [3H]glycine and [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid were not. Reserpinization (5 mg/kg, i.p., 24 h before preparation) only slightly reduced the initial rate of [3H]noradrenaline uptake by synaptosomes. However, when reserpinized synaptosomes were osmotically shocked, most of the newly accumulated radioactivity was released; this radioactivity was identified chromatographically as [3H]noradrenaline. On the basis of the findings with reserpinized preparations, it seems likely that (1) the rapid intrasynaptosomal binding involves synaptic vesicles and (2) the neuronal membrane transport system itself may be capable of driving the uptake of noradrenaline by nerve-terminals.

The air concentration varied between 10 and 10,000 ppm; and the exposure time, between 0.5 and 24 h. The resulting solvent concentrations in kidney and brain were about the same, but the liver concentrations were usually somewhat higher for both solvents. There was a linear dependence between inspired air concentration and tissue concentrations at fixed exposure times. A correlation between blood and organ concentrations was observed in animals exposed at different inhalation air concentrations but not in animals exposed only at one fixed concentration. The ratios between the concentrations of the solvents in the organs and blood were higher for n-octane than for methylchloroform. The ratios increased as the exposure concentration increased for all organs studied in the case of n-octane but only for the liver in the case of methylchloroform. When the exposure dose, i.e., inspired air concentration X time, was generated in different ways, a high concentration during a short exposure resulted in a ten times higher organ concentration than a low concentration during a long exposure. The liver, kidney, and brain concentrations generally did not differ more than twice between methylchloroform and n-octane after exposure of the same concentration and duration. The blood concentration, however, was much less in n-octane exposed animals than in methylchloroform exposed ones. A pharmacokinetic model with both uptake and elimination of the first order fitted the empirical data better for methylchloroform than a model with zero order uptake and first order elimination.

All experiments were done in the presence of 1 micron propranolol in order to minimize interference from beta-adrenoceptors. 1. Phenylephrine increased the force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal effects (about 200% of control) occurred at 30 micron phenylephrine. 2. The positive inotropic effect (PIE) of phenylephrine was antagonized by phentolamine. Phentolamine, 5 micron, produced a parallel shift of the concentration-response curve for the PIE of phenylephrine by about two log units to the right. 3. The PIE of 30 micron phenylephrine occurred without any detectable increase in the c-AMP levels of the preparations. 4. The PIE of 30 micron phenylephrine developed about three times more slowly than the PIE of an equieffective concentration of isoprenaline. 5. The PIE of phenylephrine was accompanied by significant, concentration-dependent increases in both time to peak force and relaxation time. 6. It is concluded that the PIE of phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol is mediated mainly by a stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors. It is unlikely to be related to an increase in c-AMP. With respect to time course and influence on the shape of the contraction curve it is qualitatively different from the effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.

Bilateral adrenalectomy reduced the activity of hepatic enzymes regulating lipogenesis (acetyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase) and decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations. On the other hand, the administration of high dosage corticosterone induced the activity of hepatic enzymes with consequent elevation in serum triglyceride levels. In animals with intact adrenals the administration of oestradiol: (a) raised plasma triglyceride levels, (b) enhanced the activity of hepatic enzymes, and (c) increased the adrenal cortex:body weight ratio. The effects (a) and (b) were not observed when both adrenals were removed prior to oestrogen therapy. High dosage corticosterone replacement was found to be essential for the oestradiol to produce its effects on hepatic enzymes and plasma triglyceride levels.

The iodinated hormone retained full biological activity as determined in both an in vivo and in vitro bioassay. The metabolism of this hormone was studied in rats of two different ages, 24 days and 8 months old. Two types of uptake were observed: Rapid accumulation followed by rapid loss or degradation, as represented by the liver, and sustained accumulation with slow degradation, as represented by the kidney and bone. The liver accumulated a large fraction of the dose in 1 minute. Most of this was degraded or gone by 10 min and nearly all by 30 min. The kidney was a primary target organ in terms of concentrating the hormone. Nearly 50% of the initially accumulated CT, however, remained undegraded 60 min post-injection. The bone, to a lesser extent, concentrated the hormone where 70% remained undegraded 60 min post-injection. The bone accumulated significantly less CT while the kidney and liver accumulated more in 8-month-old rats compared to 24-day-old rats. This suggests that the relative ineffectiveness of CT in older animals as a hypocalcemic agent may be due in part to the inability of the bone to accumulate available hormone.", "pmid": "849723", "mesh_set": "D000375 D000818 D001862 D001842 D002116 D002118 D007457 D007553 D007668 D008099 D008297 D051381 D012474", "score": 16.210197, "rank": 3990, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Elevation of red cell 2,3-DPG concentration leads to a numerical decrease of the \"CO2-Bohr coefficient\" referring to plasma pH. The \"fixed acid-Bohr coefficients\" are numerically smaller than the corresponding \"CO2-Bohr coefficients\" and exhibit a maximum at normal red cell 2,3-DPG concentrations. The Bohr coefficients referring to red cell pH are distinctly higher than those referring to plasma pH, especially at high 2,3-DPG levels. This is due on the one hand to the physico-chemical properties of the intact red cell membrane, and on the other hand to a 2,3-DPG-induced decrease in the ratio deltapHcell/deltapHplasma.

Lungs were subsequently isolated, artificially ventilated, and perfused in a recirculating system with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, pH 7.4 containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.25 muM [14C] 5-HT. 5HT clearance was calculated from the disappearance rate of [ 14C] 5-HT from the perfusate. In normal rats exposed to 100% O2, there was a progressive reduction in the clearance of 5-HT with increasing duration of O2 exposure. Compared to lungs from air-exposed controls, clearance was depressed 20% (P less than 0.01) after 18 h, 22% (P less than 0.01) after 24 h, and 35% (P less than 0.001) after 48 h. With vitamin E-deficient rats, the reduction in 5-HT clearance occurred after a shorter exposure time and was of greater magnitude than in rats on a normal diet. Depression of 5HT clearance by the lungs is an early alteration of lung function fue to hyperoxia and is potentiated by vitamin E deficiency. The most likely mechanism for the depression of 5-HT clearance is interference with the transport properties of lung endothelium.", "pmid": "833074", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001835 D004305 D004727 D008168 D008297 D010100 D051381 D012701 D014811", "score": 27.955444, "rank": 648, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Both Pi and oxalate had little effect on the initial rate of uptake but a pronounced effect on the capacity of Ca uptake measured after 20 min which was greater in the presence of oxalate than that of Pi (5 mM each). The presence or absence of sucrose in the uptake medium had a significant effect on oxalate-induced potentiation of Ca uptake but not on that potentiated by Pi or that measured in the absence of either potentiating anion. A part of Ca accumulated additionally under the influence of sucrose could be removed by washing microsomes with KCl. Another significant difference between the pontentiating effect of oxalate and Pi was observed when the pH of the incubation medium was varied. In the presence of oxalate the pH optimum was between 6.4--6.8, whereas that in its absence or in the presence of Pi the optimal pH was around 7.2. Reduction in pH from 7.2 to 6.8 along with the substitution of KCl by sucrose resulted in 3-fold increase in Ca uptake when oxalate was used as the potentiating anion.

The degree of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, which provides an index of the \"microviscosity\" of the lipid regions of the membrane, is exceptionally high in microvillus membranes, the highest yet reported in normal biological membranes. Both the membrane proteins and lipids were found to contribute to the high values. With each of the three probes the polarization values are higher in ileal microvillus membranes as compared to membranes from proximal intestinal segments. Temperature-dependence studies of the fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene and anthroylstearate demonstrate a phase transition in microvillus membranes and in liposomes prepared from their lipid extracts at approximately 26+/-2 degrees C. Ambient pH influences markedly the diphenylhexatriene fluorescence polarization in microvillus membranes but has little effect on that of human erythrocyte ghost membranes. The \"microviscosity\" of jejunal microvillus membranes is maximal at pH 6.5-7.0 and decreases as much as 50% at pH 3.0, an effect which depends largely upon the membrane proteins. Addition of calcium ions to suspensions of microvillus membranes increases the fluorescence polarization of retinol and anthroyl-stearate, but not that of diphenyl-hexatriene. This confirms the localization of the last compound to the hydrophobic interior of the membrane, relatively distant from the hydrophilic head groups of the polar lipids.

Although the results of bilateral experiments could generally be accounted for in terms of the theory of independent sites, there were some exceptions, and cyclic comparisons were inconsistent. 4. All the comparisons made were compatible with a model in which site-interaction occurred, but it was not possible to decide whether the sites were intrinsically identical or not. For most species this corresponded to positive cooperativity, but for rabbit it was negative. 5.

Furthermore, they measured the concentrations of typical metabolites and ascertained parameters that are of importance in energy metabolism. The concentrations of acetyl CoA and free fatty acids in the livers of mini pigs were significantly greater than those in the livers of land race pigs, whereas the cholesterol, glycerol, triglyceride and acetoacetate concentrations were reduced. The activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (E.C.1.1.1.49.), citrate synthase (E.C.4.1.3.7.) and ATP citrate lyase (E.C.4.1.3.8.) were lower in the livers of mini pigs than in the livers of land race pigs, whereas the activity of fatty acid synthase was higher. The concentrations of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were lower in the livers of mini pigs than in those of land race pigs. In land race pigs, the metabolic process seems, therefore, to be determined in favour of the degradation of free fatty acids and of the generation of energy. In mini pigs, lipogenesis in the liver appears to be the decisive metabolic pathway.

{"title": "Effects of strong electrolyte upon the activity of Clostridium perfringens sialidase toward sialyllactose and sialoglycolipids.", "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens sialidase was purified by affinity chromatography. Kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with sialyllactose and with mixed sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) as substrates. With the latter substrate in 0.01 M Tris-acete in the absence of strong electrolyte, the pH optimum for enzymatic activity was 6.8. Addition of strong electrolyte (0.01 to 0.10 M Nac1) to the reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the pH optimum, Enzymatic activity at pH 5.8 rose approximately 2.5-fold; a concomitant loss of activity at pH 6.8 was also observed. The alteration of enzymatic activity caused by strong electrolyte were dependent upon changes in Vmax. Km remained nearly invariant. Thus, a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a highly active form occurred as a function of strong electrolyte concentration. Determination of the pK values of the active functional groups of C. perfringens sialidase revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were exerted upon the pKa group of the enzyme. Strong electrolyte appeared to shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions between polyanionic sialoglycolipid micelles and the enzyme molecule, thus protecting the pKa group from inactivation. In comparision with the effects of strong electrolyte upon enzymatic activity toward the sialoglycolipid substrate, those observed with the monovalent substrate, sialyllacthose, were minor. Collectively, these findings indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative substrate specificity of C. perfringens sialidase at a given pH. Furthermore, they explain the low pH optima and skewed pH profiles previously reported for enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates.", "pmid": "384", "mesh_set": "D003016 D006863 D007700 D009439 D009994 D012965", "score": 16.345778, "rank": 3911, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The enhanced food consumption occurred when the animals were in a novel situation, in a situation which they had previously experienced, or in their home cage, in which they were used to eating in the daytime within 30 min. Studies with two benzodiazepines showed this effect to be maximal between 10 to 30 min after injection and to disappear 4 hrs after injection. Moreover, minor tranquilizers reduce the latency before eating of rats and mice tested in a new situation. These results and the observation of anti-anxiety drugs-induced hyperphagia in satiated animals suggest that: 1. The enhanced food consumption of a non familiar food in a novel situation induced by the minor tranquilizers could hardly be related only to their anti-anxiety action. 2. The existence of some inhibitory controls (endogenous satiety in daytime or satiety after recent absorption) is not essential for the action of the minor tranquilizers. 3.

When the ouabain-sensitive K influx or the ouabain-sensitive Cs influx is measured as a function of the extracellular concentration of K or Cs in Na-free solutions the resulting saturation curve at first rises more rapidly than a rectangular hyperbola, i.e. the curve is antisigmoid. 2. If the ouabain-sensitive K influx or the ouabain-sensitive Cs influx is measured in Na-free solutions at a fixed low concentration of K or Cs and at varying concentrations of Li, the influx decreases monotonically as the Li concentration rises and there is no evidence of competitive activation. 3. These findings can be accounted for by a model which proposes that there are two binding sites for K or Cs and that both the singly loaded and doubly loaded pump is capable of transport. 4. Extracellular Na changes the shape of both the K and the Cs saturation curve from antisigmoid to sigmoid. Dixon plots (1/ouabain-sensitive influx versus Na concentration at fixed K or Cs concentration) are linear at intermediate concentrations of K or Cs. 5. Na does not change the rate of K influx if the measurements are made at nearly saturating K concentrations using cells with nearly saturating internal Na concentrations. The effect of outside Na cannot therefore be explained by any mechanism which requires that Na alter the Vmax of the pump. 6. Measurement of the ouabain-sensitive Cs influx as a function of the external Cs concentration in solutions with different fixed Na concentrations results in curves which change from antisigmoid in Na-free solutions to sigmoid as the Na concentration rises. Dixon plots are linear at all but the lowest and highest Cs concentrations. 7. The resulting curves are best fit by equations which result from a model which proposes that Na acts both as a dead-end competitive inhibitor and as a heterotropic allosteric effector. Simpler models which propose either that Na acts solely as a dead-end competitive inhibitor or as a heterotropic allosteric effector do not fit as well as the more complicated model. 8.

The difference spectrum of the absorbance changes of plastocyanin in situ was separated from superimposing absorbance changes by flash titration described in the preceding paper (Haehnel, W. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 305, 618-631). Relative amounts of 2 : 1 electron equivalents were observed for plastocyanin and chlorophyll a1 (P-700). 2. A balance of the electron equivalents released from reduced plastoquinone and simultaneously accepted by oxidized plastocyanin, cytochrome f and chlorophyll a1 indicated a quantitative electron transfer. Additional electron carriers between plastoquinone and light reaction I can be excluded with an accuracy of about +/-0.3 electron equivalents per light reaction II. 3. The time course of the absorbance changes of plastocyanin was measured at 584 nm with negligible interference with other absorbance changes. The reduction kinetics show an initial lag followed by a rise with a half time of about 20 ms. The redox states of plastocyanin and chlorophyll a1 during this reduction via the rate-limiting step between the light reactions and during oxidation by weak far-red light suggest a true equilibrium constant of about 20. 4. The simultaneous oxidation and reduction kinetics of plastoquinone, cytochrome f, plastocyanin and chlorophyll a1 induced by two successive groups of saturating flashes after far-red illumination were measured. The oxidation kinetics of plastocyanin and the simultaneous reduction kinetics of chlorophyll a1 after the single flashes indicate a quantitative electron transfer with a half time of 200 mus. 5.

In contrast to TSH, NADPH added to homogenates and slices enhanced deiodination significantly. However, several arguments, including a review of the literature, strongly militate against the hypothesis of an increased intracellular concentration of the coenzyme NADPH being the prerequisite to enhanced deiodination. The results suggest that deiodinase activity in acutely stimulated thyroids is not limited by the intracellular concentration of the enzyme itself nor by the availability of co-enzyme. Therefore, the increased iodide release induced by acute TSH stimulation is a mere consequence of the enhanced thyroglobulin proteolysis and does not require higher enzyme concentration.

The reaction of the class-I thiol groups with 2-Py-S-S-2-Py was studied in the pH range 6-11 at 25 degrees C(I = 0.1 mol/l) by stopped-flow spectrophotometry, and the analogous reaction of the class-II thiol groups by conventional spectrophotometry. 5.

{"title": "Skeletal muscle necrosis following membrane-active drugs plus serotonin.", "abstract": "Administration of imipramine plus serotonin (5-HT) to rats has been proposed as an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We studied the skeletal muscle necrosis produced in male rats given 5-HT after pretreatment with imipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants, or antihistamines, which like the tricyclic antidepressants, can block neuronal reuptake of 5-HT. Following one of these agents plus 5-HT, 20 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.), necrosis was more severe in the soleus muscle than the quadriceps. There was no significant difference in the incidence of necrosis in the soleus and quadriceps muscles following one of these agents plus 5-HT, 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.). After one of these agents plus 5-HT i.p., but not 5-HT s.c., extensive necrosis was significantly more frequent and severe in the quadriceps muscle than after 5-HT s.c. Chlorpheniramine (CP) plus 5-HT, 2.5 mg/kg intravenously, produced less muscle necrosis than CP plus 5-HT s.c. or i.p. The necrosis produced by CP plus 5-HT s.c. was comparable ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection site. The necrosis following CP plus 5-HT i.p. was maximal at 24 hr and remained fairly constant until 5 days. Regeneration was prominent by 7 days. The muscle necrosis  produced by CP plus 5-HT is blocked by some 5-HT blockers, e.g., methiotepin and methysergide. It is also partially blocked by denervation. The capacity of tricyclic antidepressants and antihistamines to block neuronal 5-HT reuptake tended to be negatively correlated with the capacity to potentiate the muscle necrosis they produced with 5-HT, which suggests that blockade of 5-HT uptake is not the mechanism of the pathology produced by the combined treatment. The tricyclic antidepressants and the antihistamines are \"membrane stabilizers-labilizers\". Other drugs which are \"membrane stabilizers-labilizers\" such as trihexyphenidyl and procaine also promoted skeletal muscle necrosis when given prior to 5-HT. It is proposed that the effects of imipramine plus 5-HT on skeletal muscle are not due to the blockade of neuronal uptake of 5-HT and subsequent vascular-induced ischemia, but reflect direct toxic effects of these agents on skeletal muscle.", "pmid": "6632", "mesh_set": "D000818 D000929 D004195 D004357 D006634 D007099 D008297 D009136 D011343 D051381 D012701 D014282", "score": 24.65033, "rank": 1072, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Two reactions were detected: (i) conversion of D-glucose-6-phosphate to a phosphorylated form of inositol, presumably inositol-1-phosphate (IP synthethase, EC5.5.1.4), and (ii) conversion of phosphorylated inositol to inositol (IP phosphatase, EC3.1.3.25).  The in vitro rate of conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to inositol was proportional to incubaion time and enzyme concentration.  The pH optimum was 7.0.  The synthesis of inositol required oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and was stimulated byNH4C1 and MgC12.  NADP substituted poorly for NAD, and NADH inhibitedthe reaction.  Phosphorylated inositol accumulated in the absence of MgC12, suggesting that inositol-phosphate is an intermediate in the pathway and that Mg ions stimulate the dephosphorylation of inositol-phosphate.  IP synthetase was inhibited approximately 20% in the presence of inositol in the reaction mixture at concentrations exceeding 1 mM.  The enzyme was repressed approximately 50-fold when inositol was present in the growth medium at concentrations exceeding 50 muM.  IP synthetase reached the fully repressed level approximately 10 h after the addition of inositol to logarithmic cultures grown in the absence of inositol.

These pulses occur in addition to the early SS1 pulse which follows every shock and which has a conduction delay of less than 1 s. 2. The threshold of the delayed SS1 response is different from the thresholds of the three known conducting systems (through-conducting nerve net, SS1, and SS2). 3. In the case of stimulation of the column, the delayed SS1 pulses do not arise at the point of stimulation but probably originate in the tentacles or upper column. The pulse origin can shift during a single burst. 4. The pathway from the point of stimulation to the site of origin of delayed SS1 pulses is endodermal. We propose that this pathway represents a fourth conducting system (Delayed Initiation System--DIS). The DIS must connect, across the mesogloea, with the ectodermal SS1. The long pulse delay and repetitive firing may derive from pacemaker activity in the DIS. The DIS pacemakers closely resemble the pacemakers connected to the through-conducting nerve net. The DIS may be neuronal. 5. Delayed SS1 pulse bursts from unattached anemones showed an earlier onset, and more pulses/burst, than those from attached anemones. 6.

After radiation therapy in lymphoma, lung, ovary, uterus, and cervical tumors, the levels decreased in 66 to 90% of the patients, whereas in glioma, breast, colon, and rectal tumors, the DNA levels decreased only in 16 to 33% of the patients. Generally, the decrease in DNA concene of tumor size and reduction of pain. Conversely, when DNA levels either increased or remained unchanged, a lack of response to the treatment was noted. Of 17 patients who died within a year, 13 showed DNA levels that remained high or unchanged, whereas only 4 showed lower levels during treatment. Persistent high or increasing DNA levels in the circulation, therefore, may signal a relapse and are probably a poor prognostic sign. The relatively high percentage (50%) of cancer patients with apparently normal DNA levels would suggest that this test may have low diagnostic value. It should be pointed out, however, that all these patients represent a selected group considered for radiation therapy, usually after surgery and/or chemotherapy. It is possible that a better correlation between DNA levels and cancer will be obtained prior to the initiation of treatment. On the other hand, DNA in the serum may be an important tool for the evaluation of therapy or the comparison of different regimens.", "pmid": "837366", "mesh_set": "D002470 D004273 D005260 D006801 D008297 D009362 D009369", "score": 12.650649, "rank": 5572, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Somatosensory determinants of lordosis in female rats: behavioral definition of the estrogen effect.", "abstract": "By coating the ventral surface of male rats with a dye, regions of contact between male and female during male mounting were recorded precisely on the female's hair and skin. The male rat touches the female's flanks, rump, tailbase, perineum, and perivaginal surfaces during the female's initiation and maintenance of lordosis. Film analyses showed that the male's paws and pelvic thrusting stimulate the female's skin with dominant frequencies between 10 and 20 per second. Somatosensory stimuli were applied by the experimenter to the female skin locations contacted by the male. Deflection of hair on the flanks or perineum alone did not cause lordosis. Light stimulation simultaneously on flanks and perineum caused lordosis only in some females given high estrogen dosages supplemented by progesterone. When flank stimuli were followed by pressure on the rump, tailbase, and perineum, lordosis was triggered reliably in hormone-treated females. Here the estrogen-dependence of the reflex was shown, and progesterone synergized with the estrogen effect. Among lordosis components, rump and head elevations in response to pressure stimuli on the rump, tailbase, and perineum appear to be hormone-sensitive. These results help to define the minimal cutaneous sensory requirement for lordosis. In turn, the estrogen effect on lordosis may be defined behaviorally as increased responsiveness to pressure on rump, tailbase, and perineal skin, after flank stimulation. These results illustrate how estrogen, progesterone, and somatosensory stimuli interact in causing lordosis, increases in the strength of one factor compensating for decreases in another.", "pmid": "838911", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004305 D004357 D004967 D005260 D011312 D011374 D051381 D012018 D012726 D014110", "score": 13.193741, "rank": 5383, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Studies on inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by palmitoylcarnitine oxidation in isolated rat heart mitochondria.", "abstract": "The oxidation of an optimal concentration of palmitoyl-carnitine, buffered with bovine serum albumin, by isolated rat heart mitochondria was found to give rise to an inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, provided that the concentration of pyruvate present in the mitochondrial incubation was less than 250 muM. The greatest degree of inactivation was found at the lowest pyruvate concentration used, 50 muM, and this concentration was adopted for further studies in which the rate of mitochondrial respiration was varied. This was done by varying the activity of added hexokinase, in the presence of ATP, MgCl2, and glucose, and thus the availability of ADP to the mitochondrion. The pyruvate concentration in the incubation was approximately stabilized by adding pyruvate on the basis of oxygen consumption, with the ratio of pyruvate consumed:O2 consumed determined by trial and error. This device allowed the maintenance of essentially steady pyruvate concentrations and ATP/ADP ratios for at least 5 min, and allowed the pyruvate dehydrogenase interconversion time to approach a steady state. Activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase after 5 or 6 min of respiration were as follows, with values given in nanomoles/min/mg of protein for incubations containing pyruvate as sole substrate, and values for incubations containing pyruvate plus palmitoylcarnitine given in parentheses: State 4, 27 (9); 55% of State 3, 54 (14); 85% of State 3, 73 (28); State 3, 90 (93). Respiratory states are defined by Chance and Williams (1955) J. Biol. Chem. 217, 409-427). Values at earlier time points are also presented so that some idea may be formed of the time course of pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivation. CoASH/acetyl-CoA, NAD+/NADH, and ATP/ADP ratios were measured at the same time points in precisely scaled up incubations. The presence of palmitoylcarnitine in State 4 was found to give essentially no change in NAD+/NADH and ATP/ADP ratios and thus the inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in that state may be attributed to a decreased CoASH/acetyl-CoA ratio. At a respiratory rate of 85% of State 3, palmitoylcarnitine did not change the ATP/ADP ratio, but lowered both CoASH/acetyl-CoA and NAD+/NADH ratios, both of which may contribute to pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivation. In State 3 there was no pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivation, despite a lowered CoASH/acetyl-CoA ratio in the presence of palmitoylcarnitine. It is concluded that ATP/ADP ratio has a pronounced effect on the interconversion of active and inactive pyruvate dehydrogenase, in according with previous work. Moreover, at a given ATP/ADP ratio, the effects of palmitoylcarnitine oxidation on enzyme interconversion are consistent with a mechanism involving the modulation of the interconversion by NAD+/NADH and CoASH/acetyl-CoA ratios...", "pmid": "838728", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002331 D007700 D008297 D008931 D009206 D010084 D010169 D011768 D011773 D051381", "score": 18.767643, "rank": 2726, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Prolactin stimulation test with perphenazine: an evaluation of plasma prolactin levels and pituitary secretory activity in the rat.", "abstract": "Many investigations of the regulation of prolactin synthesis and release are based on single plasma prolactin determinations. The purpose of the present experiment was to ascertain whether groups of rats (i.e. young or adult, male or female animals, being either intact, gonadectomized or gonadectomized and treated with oestrone), differing  in age and/or endocrine status, will react to a single dose of perphenazine by an acute release of pituitary prolactin in proportion to their initial plasma prolactin levels. No consistent relation existed between the classification of the twelve groups of rats into three categories of basal plasma prolactin levels (i.e. less than 20, 25-50, greater than 125 ng/ml) and their response to perphenazine. Even though all groups showed a highly significant increase of plasma prolactin levels the magnitude of the maximum prolactin response at 30 min varied greatly within the groups of one category and thus was not related to the initial prolactin levels. The effect of 14 days of oestrone treatment in increasing plasma prolactin levels in gonadectomized animals was greatest in young and adult male rats, less in young females and not significant in adult females. The results obtained after perphenazine treatment in the latter group made it clear that the effect of oestrogen treatment on prolactin release can be completely blocked by increasing synthesis and/or release of the prolactin-release inhibiting factor (PIF). Since perphenazine induces decrease of pituitary prolactin and a concomitant increase of plasma prolactin levels through lowered PIF-action, the positive effect of oestrogens on prolactin release (as observed in gonadectomized male and young female rats) apparently is caused by a different mode of action. The implications of these findings for the regulation of prolactin release, as affected by the endocrine status of the rat, is discussed. Moreover, comparison of prolactin lost from the pituitary and gained in the circulation of the experimental animals, with amounts of prolactin that were observed to disappear from plasma during the experiment, provided suggestive evidence that the capacity to synthesize and/or eliminate prolactin, after a sudden provoked release of the hormone, differed among the groups. The rates of synthesis by the pituitary, of release from the pituitary into the circulation as well as of elimination of the hormone from the circulation (equally involved in determing actual plasma levels) are thought, therefore, to be far more important for the elucidation of prolactin regulation than single plasma prolactin determinations.", "pmid": "3617", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002369 D004970 D005260 D008297 D010546 D010902 D011388 D011389 D051381 D013268", "score": 27.363115, "rank": 705, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The 19F chemical shifts of the resonance lines differ for the three cysteines and so does their behavior with pH changes. The resonance signals with chemical shifts at 615 and 800 Hz upfield from trifluoroacetic acid correspond to modified cysteine-82 and -45 and have tentatively been assigned in this order. The 615-Hz resonance is affected by pH changes that fit best the influence of a single ionizing residue. On the 800-Hz line, the pH changes appear to be the influence of a minimum of two ionizing residues. The 19F resonance from modified Cys-390 is pH independent in the pH range 5-9 for the pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxamine phosphate, and apoenzyme forms of the enzyme. Occupation of the active site by a quasi-enzyme-substrate complex, trifluoromethionine pyridoxyl phosphate, affects the 19F chemical shift of modified Cys-390, making it pH dependent with a pK value of 8.4. The 19F NMR properties of the pyridoxal form of Cys-390-modified enzyme can be used to monitor some ligand interactions with the active-center region. Addition of alpha-ketoglutarate or succinate to the ketone labeled enzyme causes a decrease in the resonance line width, and titrations show that this procedure is a good method with which to study the affinity of the enzyme for these ligands. The interpretation of the chemical shift and line-width characteristics of the 19F resonance arising from Cys-390 are most consistent with a model in which the region around this residue seems to be affected by conformational changes arising from substrate binding  to the active-center subsites in productive (covalent) manner. Nonproductive complexes which possess fast ligand-protein exchange, such as those between alpha-ketoglutarate or succinate with the pyridoxal phosphate form of the enzyme, may result only in a greater degree of freedom for Cys-390.", "pmid": "15584", "mesh_set": "D001219 D001665 D005033 D005461 D005463 D006863 D007700 D009682 D011485 D011487 D014269", "score": 13.154349, "rank": 5400, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Miniature end-plate potentials (m.e.p.ps) were readily detectable in Ba solutions despite a depolarized muscle membrane. Studies on the e.p.p. in curarized preparations bathed with different concentrations of Ca and Ba suggest that Ba may compete with Ca in the process by which depolarization of the nerve terminal leads to the release of ACh. Repetitive nerve stimulation at 1 Hz in Ba solutions caused 5-20 fold increases in m.e.p.p. frequencies (7 experiments). Stimulation of Ba-bathed preparations at 10 Hz elevated m.e.p.p. frequencies to very high levels that could not be measured accurately (''100/s). It is suggested that the asynchronous discharge of m.e.p.ps produced by repetitive nerve stimulation is the electrophysiological correlate of the evoked ACh outflow in Ba solutions detected previously by bioassay of ther perfusion fluid.", "pmid": "837001", "mesh_set": "D000109 D000818 D001001 D001464 D002118 D009469 D010525", "score": 19.710892, "rank": 2365, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Chloride conductance of the amphiuma red cell membrane.", "abstract": "Like most other red cells, the giant erythrocytes of Amphiuma means possess a system for rapid exchange of chloride across the membrane. Also, there are indications that the net transport of chloride in these cells is slow. The size of Amphiuma erythrocytes allows direct measurements of membrane potential with microelectrodes. The present work exploits the possibility that such measurements can be used to give a quantitative estimate of the chloride conductance (GCl) of the Amphiuma red cell membrane. The membrane potential was measured as a function of extracellular chloride concentration (5-120mM), using an impermeant anion (Para-amino-hippurate) as a substitute. Furthermore, the effect of different pH values (6.0-7.2) was studied. For each extracellular chloride concentration the membrane potential was determined at a pH at which hydroxyl, hydrogen, and bicarbonate ions were in electrochemical equilibrium. From these membrane potentials and the corresponding chloride concentrations in the medium (at constant intracellular ion concentrations), the GCl of the membrane was calculated to be 3.9 x 10-7 omega-1 cm-2. This value is some six orders of magnitude smaller than that calculated from the rate of tracer exchange under equilibrium conditions. The experimental strategy used gives the values for a \"partial transference number\" which takes into account only ions which are not in electrochemical equilibrium. Whereas this approach gives a value for GCl, it does not permit calculation of the overall membrane conductance. From the calculated value of GCl it is possible to estimate that the maximal value of the combined conductances of hydroxyl (or proton) and bicarbonate ions is 0.6 x 10-7 omega-1 cm-2. The large discrepancy between the rate of exchange of chloride and its conductance is in agreement with measurements on human and sheep red cells employing the ionophore valinomycin to increase the potassium conductance of the membrane. The results in the present study were, however, obtained without valinomycin and an accompaning assumption of a constant field in the membrane. Therefore, the present measurements give independent support to the above mentioned conclusions.", "pmid": "24748", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001639 D002712 D004553 D004910 D004912 D006863 D008433 D008564 D014562", "score": 9.750055, "rank": 6068, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Excitatory monosynaptic connexions between two groups of cells located on the dorsal surface of the ganglion near the cerebropleural connectives were analyzed in detail. The monosynapticity of these connexions was established not only by the strict one-to-one correlation between presynaptic action potential and excitatory postsynaptic response (EPSP) and the constant latency for any given cell pair, but also by the following criteria: (a) gradual change in the EPSP following tetraethylammonium injection into the presynaptic neurone, (b) sustained EPSP in the presence of a high external calcium ion concentration, (c) sensitivity of the EPSP amplitude to presynaptic polarization. Iontophoretic application of acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and glutamate on the postsynaptic cells elicited excitatory responses in many cases. Inhibitory responses were obtained by local iontophoresis of dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and occasionally also by acetylcholine. The only agent found to block the EPSP was bufotenine, which also readily blocked the 5-hydroxytryptamine response. Bufotenine was completely ineffective on the acetylcholine or glutamate excitatory responses. Of the various cholinolytics tested, none had an effect on the EPSP. Our data all point to 5-hydroxytryptamine as a transmitter in the studied synaptic connexions.

The feeding of synthesized LAL to rats at dietary levels of 100 ppm and above induced typical renal changes, called nephrocytomegalia. No such changes or any other indications of toxicity were observed, however, upon feeding much higher levels of LAL (up to 6,000 ppm) when provided as the protein-bound compound in alkali-treated casein or soybean protein. When set free by complete acid hydrolysis, LAL induced considerable renal activity, comparable to that of the synthetic compound. These results indicate that alkali treatment of proteins does not induce nephrotoxic properties provided that the compound remains protein-bound. Some nephrotoxic activity was observed, however, with peptide-boound LAL in break-down products (molecular weight less than 5,000) of alkali-treated casein, but considerably less than that of the free compound. LAL-analyses in blood, urine, and feces of rats fed free or protein-bound LAL indicated a positive correlation between intestinal absorption and nephrotoxic potential.

Fresh human blood was employed in the investigation which used a colorimetric method for the determination of hemolysis. Prior to the examination of the hemolytic activity of each drug in the various vehicles, the vehicles themselves were examined for their ability to protect erythrocytes from hemolysis. Little to no hemolysis occurred in normal saline solution (the standard), dextrose 2.5% in normal saline, dextrose 5% in normal saline, dextrose 10% in normal saline, and lactated Ringer's injection. Low levels of hemolysis occurred in dextrose 5% in water, invert sugar 10% in water, and M/6 sodium lactate in water. High levels of hemolysis occurred when red blood cells were suspended in dextrose 2.5% in water. Invert sugar 10% in normal saline and fructose 10% in water caused red cell denaturation resulting in brown cells and hemolysate rather than the characteristic red color. This denaturation was attributed to the hydrogen ion concentration of these two solutions, both having pH values less than 4.0. Vehicles of dextrose in saline, dextrose in water, lactated Ringer's, and invert sugar in water reduced the level of drug-induced hemolysis for the drugs tested compared to that which occurred in normal saline solution.

Oleic acid, monoolein, lecithin, and lysolecithin enhanced taurocholate uptake and transfer in the jejunum, each lipid exhibiting an optimal concentration at which the bile acid fluxes were maximal. The maximal rates of bile acid uptake observed with the various lipids were close to four times the uptake rates found with the lipid-free taurocholate medium, whereas serosal transfer rates under optimal conditions were enhanced about six-fold. The optimal concentrations differed widely among the various lipids, being inversely related to the lipids' polarity. Simultaneous measurement of taurocholate and [3H]-labelled oleic acid showed that under optimal conditions, when the molar concentration of oleic acid was about equal to that of the bile acid, the fatty acid and bile acid also exhibited closely similar rates of absorption. At other fatty acid concentrations, the fractional rate of absorption of the bile acid was much lower than that of the fatty acid. The rates of uptake and serosal transfer of pure taurocholate by the ileum exceeded those of the jejunum by factors of about 7 and 15, respectively, but in the presence of lipids this difference in absorptive capacity for bile acid between the distal and proximal segment largely disappeared.", "pmid": "846303", "mesh_set": "D000818 D005989 D007082 D007408 D007413 D007583 D007700 D008055 D008244 D008297 D009829 D010713 D051381 D013656", "score": 23.156067, "rank": 1358, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Fatty acid and ketone body metabolism in the rat: response to diet and exercise.", "abstract": "This study was designed to measure the response of key enzymes of ketone body metabolism in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver to diet and exercise, two conditions known to influence ketone body utilization. A 3 (diet: control, high fat, or high carbohydrate) X 2 (kill condition: rested or exhausted) X 2 (training: trained or untrained) factorial design was used to estimate main experimental effects as well as identify significant interactions of the variables. Physical training (treadmill running) was associated with a doubling of the activity of skeletal muscle 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, a key enzyme in extrahepatic ketone body utilization. The activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of liver ketone body production, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthetase (HMG CoA synthetase), was not greatly influenced by training or exhuastive exercise indicating that the metabolic control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely be a function of the supply of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity of HMG CoA synthetase. Feeding a high fat diet, on the other hand, significantly increased the activity of liver HMG CoA synthetase, indicating that the ketosis of fat feeding may be of a different nature than that of exercise. The results of this study indicate that physical training is associated with biochemical adaptations in ketone body metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation, and that trained individuals are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis of exercise than untrained individuals.", "pmid": "475", "mesh_set": "D000101 D000818 D003065 D004040 D004041 D003576 D005227 D006904 D007651 D007657 D007662 D008099 D008297 D009132 D009206 D010084 D005082 D011506 D051381 D013466", "score": 19.710655, "rank": 2366, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}
{"title": "Studies on the phosphorylated intermediates of a K+-stimulated ATPase from rabbit gastric mucosa.", "abstract": "A density gradient-purified microsomal membrane preparation from rabbit fundic gastric mucosa was used for a detailed study of the K+-stimulated ATPase and associated intermediate reactions. Membranes incubated with gamma-[32P]ATP show the rapid incorporation of 32P into phosphoprotein. Phosphoprotein levels were markedly reduced (1) when ATP hydrolysis went to completion or (2) upon addition of unlabeled ATP, thus suggesting the participation of a rapid turnover phosphorylated intermediate in the gastric microsomal ATPase. Addition of K+, Rb+ or Tl+ greatly reduced the level of the intermediate while stimulating ATPase activity; the observed affinities of these cations were similar for the effects on both ATPase and intermediate levels, with Tl+ greater than K+ greater than Rb+. Neither ATPase nor intermediate were stimulated by Na+, and ouabain was without effect on the reactions, thus differentiating this system from the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. Addition of various inhibitors showed differential effects on the partial reactions of the gastric ATPase system. N-ethylmaleimide and Zn2+ showed characteristics of completely abolishing the K+-stimulated component of ATPase as well as the effects of K+ in reducing the level of intermediate, thus suggesting that these agents exert their inhibitory effect on a phosphoprotein phosphatase partial reaction. F- abolished the K+-stimulated ATPase, but its more complex effects on the intermediate suggested an additional reaction step within the domain of the phosphorylated intermediate.

To confirm this hypothesis, in rabbits the small intestine was damaged severely by inducing total intestinal ischemia, which occurs as mesenteric infarction also in human subjects and is accompanied by histamine release.

Neutrophil viability and function were assessed by measuring the ability of the tagged neutrophils to circulate and to migrate into subcutaneous polyvinyl sponges. Unstored neutrophils disappeared exponentially from the circulation with a t1/2 of 3.2 h and gave a zero time recovery of 30.5%.

With cells stored for up to 72 h at 4 degrees C, recovery returned to normal values after 1-2 h. Room temperature stored cells, in contrast, showed evidence of irreversible damage at 48-h storage with low recovery for the entire time span studied.

{"title": "Retrograde invasion of lobster stretch receptor somata in control of firing rate and extra spike patterning.", "abstract": "1. Extra spikes may be interleaved in the otherwise rhythmic discharge pattern of the lobster stretch receptor neuron, about 2 ms after an expected spike. A constant input to the neuron is maintained by injecting current intrasomatically. The axon recovers its excitability while the retrograde invasion of the soma and dendrites is still in progress, which provide electrotonic currents to reexcite the axon. 2. While extra spikes in the axon often arise from a prolonged somatic (dendritic?) depolarization, they may also arise from a delayed retrograde invasion of the soma. 3. Failure of retrograde invasion may cause a sudden jump in the rate of rhythmic discharge, demonstrating the role of the soma-dendritic afterhyperpolarization in the regulation of rhythmic firing rate. 4. The history of repetitive firing is often important. Because extra spikes often first appear during a decline in firing rate, turning on and then off, an additional current may sometimes activate the extra spike mode, thus doubling the resting firing rate in a metastable manner. Another mestastable state is associated with failure of retrograde invasion. 5. Extra spikes augment the high end of the frequency-current curve in some receptor neurons; in other cases, the extra spikes are seen only at low rhythmic firing rates, dropping out as current reaches intermediate values to create a paradoxical negative-sensitivity region (decline in total spikes per second with increasing current). 6. The results suggest that both the extent and the speed of active retrograde invasion of the soma and dendrites are likely candidates for pathophysiological mechanisms, since they may control whether extra spikes are generated.", "pmid": "833621", "mesh_set": "D000818 D004558 D004594 D008465 D008121", "score": 15.338181, "rank": 4424, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Penicillin markedly decreased the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis and enhanced the rate of hydrolysis of existing peptidoglycan. Hydrolysis was initiated immediately after addition of penicillin; cellular lysis did not occur until a considerable percentage of the peptidoglycan had been degraded. Cellular lysis was not due to penicillin per se but resulted from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. When cells were grown in media buffered with N-2-hydroxyethyl piperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid at pH 6, penicillin did not cause lysis; however, at this pH, peptidoglycan hydrolysis occurred and cells lost viability at the same rate as in the control (pH 7.2).

Ethanol dosages in the n mols/kg range stimulated glucose utilization rates more in ethanol-than in water-preferring mice, while intermediate dosages (micron and low mmol/kg) produced equal stimulation but at different dosages. Pharmacological dosages (20-88 mmols/kg) inhibited glucose rates in water-preferring mice. The inhibition was released at 44 mmols/kg in ethanol-preferring mice. 3. Inhibition release was shown to be associated more with glucose carbons other than one, and considered consistent with a sodium-plus potassium-activated ATPase mechanism. 4. Intermediate ethanol dosage changes could be assigned to differences induced in glucose carbon one metabolism with H2O2-catalase and/or microsomal-ethanol-oxidizing systems (MEOS) mechanisms. 5.

The Km values for S-adenosyl-L-methionine, histone H4, and an ancephalitogenic basic protein are 7.6 X 10(-6), 2.5 X 10(-5), and 7.1 X 10(-5) M, respectively, and the Ki value for S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine is 2.62 X 10(-6) M.

The banding pattern of cultured human fibroblast extracts was distinctive: in addition to activity in the area of Bands 1-6 a sharp band at pI 5.1 was observed with both enzyme stains. This latter band was also present in metachromatic leukodystrophy fibroblast extracts. However, in this case the band did not appear when the specific aryl-sulfatase A stain was used. Enzyme Bands 1, 2 and 3 from urine were isolated by extraction of the gel. The three bands refocused in their initial positions; showed nearly identical enzymatic activities toward methylumbelliferyl sulfate, mitrocatechol sulfate, cerebroside sulfate and ascorbic acid 2-sulfate; and demonstrated equivalent immunological competence by antibody titration. The banding pattern of urinary arylsulfatase A was unchanged with neuraminidase treatment, whereas Bands 4-6 of the liver enzyme were converted to Bands 1-3 by this treatment.

{"title": "Characterization of the protease activity in the chemotactic factor inactivator.", "abstract": "The chemotactic factor inactivator (CFI) isolated from human serum contains a kininase activity that causes extensive hydrolysis of bradykinin. The highly chemotactic synthetic peptide Met-Leu-Phe was completely hydrolyzed by CFI preparations. The release of the constituent amino acids from this peptide coincided with a loss of its chemotactic activity. The N-formyl, but not the amide derivative, of the leukotactic peptide Met-Leu-Phe was resistant to the action of CFI, as evidenced by chemotactic and biochemical assays. Examination of the specificity of CFI proteolysis revealed that short polypeptide substrates are degraded sequentially from the amino terminus. Larger peptides are less extensively hydrolyzed, and the patterns of hydrolysis are more complex. Inactivation of the bacterial chemotactic factors by CFI was overcome by the addition of high concentrations of peptides which were substrated for CFI. CFI preparations readily hydrolyzed the peptide Arg-Phe-Ala. The constituent amino acids were conveniently identified by thin-layer chromatography method. This procedure afforded a rapid assay for measuring CFI activity in the whole human serum as well as in fractions throughout the purification steps. Moreover, CFI also hydrolyzed L-leucyl-beta-napthylamide at rates comparable to peptides. Thus, L-leucyl-beta-napthylamide served as a useful substrate for estimating  CFI activity in preparations at various stages of purification. This substrate was also useful in kinetic studies.

{"title": "Biological activity of agarose-immobilized catecholamines.", "abstract": "Catecholamines substituted to agarose were synthesized in various ways. Norepinephrine and isoproterenol were linked to p-aminobenzamidohexyl agarose by an azo linkage to the catechol ring. Norepinephrine was also couple to hexyl agaros via the amino group, forming an amino, guanidino or amido bond. Biological activity of the immobilized catecholamines was determined by assessing their abilities to interact with adenylate cyclase in several membrane preparations and intact preparations of erythrocytes. In dog heart membranes, stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the catecholamine-gels could be accounted for by leached hormone which had been released from the gels. In frog erythrocyte membranes, leaching was minimal and no significant stimulation of adenylate cyclase was observed. Agarose-immobilized catecholamines, however, competitively inhibited isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase in these erythrocyte membranes indicating that catecholamines which are bound to agarose interact with the beta-adrenergic receptors as antagonists rather than agonists. When tested on intact frog erythrocytes, agarose immobilzed catecholamines did not increase the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, although isoproterenol caused as 8-10 fold rise in these levels. Similarly, when tested for antagonist activity in the intact cells the agarose-catecholamines failed to inhibit the stimulation of cyclic AMP caused by isoproterenol. The difference observed in the beta-adrenergic antagonist activity of the agarose-bound catecholamines in membrane preparations and intact cells can be attributed to steric factors which could have prevented the access of the bead-bound ligands with the surface of the cell or to the possibility that receptors might be buried in the membrane matrix.", "pmid": "9146", "mesh_set": "D000262 D000273 D000318 D000818 D001665 D002462 D000242 D004285 D007545 D009206 D009638 D011134 D051381 D012685", "score": 21.40477, "rank": 1787, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Increasing the stimulus frequency between 2 and 50 HZ increased the rate of block by procaine but not by benzocaine. 3.

Changing between 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2) and acid Ringer solution (pH 6.0) and washing out 10 mM procaine (pH 5.5) with neutral Ringer solution also led to a non-monotonic change in VA. 5. If hyperpolarizing pulses (30 ms, 20 mV) preceded the stimuli, changing the frequency of the pulse pairs led to a gradual moderate relief of block in procaine, turning off prepulses (at 10 HZ) to a gradual increase of block. In benzocaine changing from 1 to 10 HZ had no effect but turning off prepulses led to a prompt large increase of block. In procaine + benzocaine the membrane responded much as in benzocaine alone. At 1 HZ (prepulses) VA in 0.4 mM procaine was smaller than in 0.4 mM procaine + 0.3 mM benzocaine. 6.

In Myxicola axons, the aminopyridines very specifically inhibited the potassium conductance when applied at concentrations of 0.1 mM to 5 mM without any apparent effect of resting membrane potential. Concentrations in excess of 5 mM were needed to inhibit noticeably the sodium conductance. Potassium conductance-voltage curves were shifted in the depolarized direction along the voltage axis with no significant change in shape. There were only minor changes in the kinetics of potassium activation. In high potassium solutions, both inward and outward potassium currents were equally sensitive to the aminopyridines. Sparteine was, in general, found to be a more potent, but somewhat less specific, inhibitor of the potassium conductance. In contrast to the aminopyridines, sparteine was more effective when applied at basic pH and in addition tended to produce a noticeable degree of potassium inactivation. When applied to the lobster neuromuscular junction, 2-aminopyridine and sparteine dramatically increased the amplitude of both excitatory and inhibitory postjunctional potentials, with little or no change in resting potential, resting input conductance, reversal potential, or miniature end plate potential amplitude or frequency.

{"title": "Cholesterol biosynthesis and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase in cultured glial and neuronal cells. Regulation by lipoprotein and by certain free sterols.", "abstract": "Regulation of cholesterol synthesis and, particularly, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was studied in C-6 glial and neuroblastoma cells. Comparison of rates of incorporation of radioactivity from [14C]-acetate or [3H]mevalonate into digitonin-precipitable sterols indicated that HMG-CoA reductase is the major rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis in both cell types. HMG-CoA reductase exhibited marked changes in enzymatic activity according to the lipoprotein content of the medium. However, significant differences were observed between the two cell types in the quantitative and temporal aspects of this regulation. Thus, in C-6 glial cells, when total serum lipoprotein was removed from the medium, reductase activity increased by 7-8-fold between 2 and 6 h later. After 24 h reductase activity in cells grown in lipoprotein-poor serum was 20-fold higher than in cells grown in regular serum. In neuroblastoma cells, under similar conditions, reductase activity did not increase at all until cells were in lipoprotein-poor serum for more then 6 h, and after 24 h, enzyme activity in cells grown in lipoprotein-poor serum was only approx. 3-fold higher than that in cells grown in regular serum. Addition of total serum lipoprotein caused a rapid decline in enzymatic activity in both cell types, with a t1/2 of 2-2.5 h; however, the onset of the decline was immediate in the glial cells but delayed 1-1.5 h in the neuronal cells. The critical regulatory component in the total lipoprotein fraction was shown to be contained in the low density lipoproteins for the reductase of both cell types. Regulation of reductase by free sterols was shown in both the glial and neuronal cells. However, effects were more marked and evolved more rapidly in the glial cells. The data thus provide important insight into the regulation of cholesterol synthesis in two cell types which are considered to be good models of neurons and glia of developing brain. The occurrence of more marked and more rapid regulation in the glial than in the neuronal cells is compatible with the important role glia play in brain lipid synthesis. The demonstration of dramatic regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by desmosterol, a sterol found in high concentration in brain early in development, may indicate a heretofore unrecognized role for this sterol in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis during maturation. 7-Ketocholesterol was shown to induce in C-6 glial cells a rate of decline of HMG-CoA reductase activity compatible with a t 1/2 of just 20 min. This extremely rapid rate of decline suggests that the effect involves an alteration in catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The mechanism of this effect remains to be determined.", "pmid": "856284", "mesh_set": "D000429 D002460 D002784 D003470 D004072 D006801 D006903 D007700 D008074 D009447 D009457 D013261", "score": 25.70742, "rank": 927, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

When the perfusate lactate concentration is above 1.5 mmol/l respiratory acidosis (simulated by high perfusate PCO2) inhibits gluconeogenesis from lactate, whereas respiratory alkalosis stimulates gluconeogenesis. 3.

The results suggest that CO2 exerts an inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis at a step between pyruvate and phosphoenolypruvate; however, this is not the only effect of CO2 on the gluconeogenic sequence.

Chloroplatinic acid was without effect. Only cis-Pt(NH3)2Cl2 produced substantial increases in the rho of poly[d(A-T)] and poly(dA) - poly(dT) with increasing metal ion concentrations. These increases were accompanied by a proportional decrease in the thermal transition temperature (Tm) of poly(dA)-poly(dT) and a sharp increase in the Tm of poly[d(A-T)]. Our results indicate  that the cis- isomer reacts with all four polymers to produce rho changes clearly distinct from those values observed after reaction with either the trans- isomer or PtCl4. These results help explain the observation by others that the cis- isomer produces greater rho changes in native DNA than the trans- isomer.

In all 3 brain areas studied, therefore, probenecid treatment resulted in a significant accumulation of conjugated DOPAC relative to free DOPAC.

{"title": "An analysis of response properties of spinal cord dorsal horn neurones to nonnoxious and noxious stimuli in the spinal rat.", "abstract": "Electrophysiological properties of neurones in the spinal cord dorsal horn were studied in decerebrated, immobilized spinal rats. Extracellular recordings were performed at the thoraco-lumbar junction level. Each track was systematically located by extracellular injection of pontamine sky blue. According to their responses to mechanical peripheral stimuli, cells were classified in four classes: Class 1 cells: Cells activated only by nonnoxious stimuli. They were divided into - 1A: hair movement and/or touch and 1B: hair movement and/or touch and pressure or pressure only. Class 2 cells: Cells driven by both nonnoxious and noxious stimuli, divided into - 2A: hair movement and/or touch, pressure, pinch and/or pin-prick, and 2B: pressure, pinch and/or pin-prick. Class 3 cells: Cells only activated by noxious stimuli (pinch and/or pin-prick). Class 4 cells: Cells responding to joint movement or pressure on deep tissues. Peripheral transcutaneous or sural nerve stimulation clearly showed that class 1 cells were activated only by A fiber input while 68% of classes 2 and 3 cells received A and C input. Histological examination indicated that cells driven only by noxious input were located either in the deepest part or in the marginal zone (lamina I) of the dorsal horn. Nevertheless, some lamina I cells were also driven by both nonnoxious and noxious stimuli. In addition, there is a great deal of overlap between class 1 and class 2 cells. This fact was confirmed by considering the wide distribution in the dorsal horn of cells receiving A and C input. However, spinal organization of the different classes of cells consists of a preferential distribution rather than a strict lamination. This study indicates that properties of dorsal horn inter-neurones in the rat have a high degree of similarity with those previously described in other species (cat and monkey).", "pmid": "832686", "mesh_set": "D000818 D003655 D004558 D005071 D006197 D007395 D008297 D009475 D010146 D010812 D051381 D012879 D013116 D013497", "score": 21.772022, "rank": 1671, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Lymphocyte subpopulations. Human red blood cell rosettes.", "abstract": "Human red blood cells (HRBC) even without prior neuraminidase treatment, could form rosettes with human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. The optimum conditions for forming these rosettes were a pH of 7-0 and a medium with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Rosette proportions became much less at a different pH or using lower concentrations of BSA, or replacing BSA with foetal calf sera (FCS) or human sera. Rosette formation was also promoted by prior treatment of HRBC or lymphocytes with neuraminidase. Mixed rosettes of HRBC and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) showed that HRBC receptors were detectable only on lymphocytes that possessed SRBC receptors, suggesting that HRBC rosette-forming cells were probably thymus-derived (T) cells. Next, the properties of human red blood cell (HRBC) and sheep red blood cell (SRBC) rosette-forming cells were investigated by comparing the ability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes to form these two types of rosettes after treatment with various inhibitory reagents. HRBC rosettes were relatively more resistant to inhibition with: (1) proteolytic agents, such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase; (2) anti-thymocyte serum (ATS); (3) metabolic inhibitors, such as sodium azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP); (4) cytochalasin B. On further incubation after trypsinization, the lymphocytes recovered some ability to form SRBC rosettes, but continued to lose more of their capability to form HRBC rosettes.

{"title": "Transport of amino acids in renal brush border membrane vesicles. Uptake of L-proline.", "abstract": "The findings (a) stereospecific counter transport; (b) equilibrium uptake of L-proline decreased with increasing medium osmolarity; and (c) L-proline and Na+ were taken up into identical intravesicular spaces, indicate that uptake of L-proline by rabbit renal brush border membranes represents transport into membrane vesicles, not surface binding to the membrane. An Na+ gradient between extravesicular and intravesicular media stimulated the initial rate of L-proline uptake about 10 times. Accumulation of the imino acid was maximal at 2 min, then decreased until the equilibrium level was attained. At the peak of this \"overshoot\" uptake of L-proline was 3-fold greater than the final equilibrium value. These results suggest that the electrochemical Na+ gradient drives the transient movement of L-proline into the membrane vesicles against its concentration gradient. Stimulation of L-proline uptake was specific for Na+. Increasing the Na+ gradient lowered the apparent Km for L-proline. Efflux of L-proline from the membrane vesicles, like uptake, showed stimulatory effects when the Na+ gradient and L-proline were on the same side, and inhibitory effects when the Na+ gradient and the imino acid were on opposite sides of the membrane. Uptake of L-proline, at a given concentration, reflected the sum of contributions from Na+ gradient-dependent and -independent transport systems. The dependent system was saturated at 4 mM L-proline. The independent system did not saturate but may represent the sum of passive diffusion and a \"carrier\"-mediated system. At physiological concentrations the rate of the Na+ gradient-dependent uptake was 5 times that in the absence of the gradient. In K+-loaded vesicles, valinomycin, but not nigericin, enhanced the Na+ gradient-dependent uptake of L-proline. Gramicidin diminished uptake. These findings indicate that the Na+ gradient-dependent transport of L-proline is an electrogenic process and suggest that the membrane potential is a determinant of L-proline transport. The Na+ gradient-dependent rate of L-proline uptake was strongly inhibited by other imino acids, suggesting that L-imino acids have a common transport system. Glycine and neutral amino acids inhibited the rate of L-proline uptake moderately, acidic amino acid and D-glucose were very weak inhibitors, and basic amino acids were without effect. In the absence of Na+, the rate of L-proline uptake was independent of the presence of other amino acids. These findings indicate that the brush border membrane is a site of amino acid recognition during vectorial transepithelial transport. It is proposed that imino and neutral amino acids inhibit transport of L-proline by competitive interaction with the L-proline \"carriers\" in addition to competition for the electrochemical Na+ gradient or membrane potential. The findings are relevant to the understanding of genetic amino acid transport disorders, such as iminoglycinuria.", "pmid": "833146", "mesh_set": "D000596 D000818 D001692 D001693 D005947 D007687 D007700 D011392 D011817 D012964", "score": 19.474619, "rank": 2446, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

However, both the total and the rotenone-insensitive NCR activities increased, with that of the rotenone-insensitive being about half of the total, which indicated that the effect of adrenalectomy was exerted on components of this enzyme localized on both the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondrion. The lack of effect on the other enzymes suggests that adrenalectomy has a relatively selective action on MAO and NCR, and does not work by a generalized increase in protein synthesis or by an effect on the FAD cofactor. The MAO increase was seen with a variety of substrates, and was due to a rise in Vmax without change in Km. The response to adrenalectomy in the summer differed from that seen in the winter.

{"title": "Simple model for hormone-activated adenylate cyclase systems.", "abstract": "A simple model is developed to explain the activation of rat liver plasma membrane adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] by guanosine nucleotides and glucagon and the dependence of the cATALYTIC RATE ON Mg2+, H+, and substrate concentrations. The basic model proposes that the adenylate cyclase system can exist in two states, A and B; that activating ligands bind preferentially to the B state; and that only the B state is active. Kinetic data are quantitatively fit to this model, and the binding constants for the interaction of the A and B states with glucagon, GTP, and guanyl-5'-ylimidodiphosphate are obtinaed. The substrates ATP and adenyl-5'-ylimidodiphosphate appear to show little preference between the A and B states, and simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics are sufficient to describe the dependence of the catalytic rate on substrate concentration under optimal conditions. The dependence of the rate on pH can be explained by postulating that one ionizable group in its acid form and one ionizable group in its basic form must be present at the active site in order for catalysis to occur. The activation and inhibition of the activity by Mg2+ can be explained by a similar mechanism with Mg2+ binding to activating and inhibiting sites. Glucagon and guanosine nucleotides appear to influence the dependence of the rate on Mg2+ and glucagon. The Mg2+ also may display some preference for the B state.

R., and Ballou, C. E. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6835-6842) is now shown to be a mixture of at least four isomers separable by gel filtration owing to differences in size and degree of methylation. The major component is 3-O-methylmannose but all contain small amounts of mannose. The molecular weights range from 2040 to 2490 and all are nonreducing. After Smith degradation, all yield a single large and one or more small fragments that give 3-O-methylmannose as the sole product of complete acid hydrolysis. The large Smith-degraded MMP components (SD-MMP) are similar to intact MMP and vary from 1830 to 2130 daltons, consistent with the loss of a single mannose; whereas the smaller fragments are the size of tri- to hexasaccharides and result from fragmentation of incompletely methylated chains. Controlled acid hydrolysis of [methyl-3H]MMP releases 6% of the methyl groups as [3H]methanol at a rate characteristic for the hydrolysis of methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. Proton magnetic resonance spectra of MMP and SD-MMP show a major methyl ether proton peak and a second small peak at higher field equivalent to about one methyl group per molecule. The results are consistent with the presence of an alpha-methyl aglycon at the reducing end of the chains. Methylation analysis of MMP isomers purified by high pressure liquid chromatography confirms that they are linear and unbranched. Methylation of [methyl-3H]MMP yields unlabeled tetra-O-methylmannose, showing that the chains are terminated by mannose. However, digestion of [methyl-3H]MMP with alpha-mannosidase releases mannose and exposes [methyl-3H]3-O-methylmannose. Smith degradation of [methyl-3H]MMP III yields a penta-to hexasaccharide product that can be resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography into two components. The distribution of radioactivity between these two fragments suggests that the chain was cleaved near the middle and that there must be an unmethylated mannose at that position. We conclude that the 3-O-methylmannose polysaccharides are linear unbranched chains of 11 to 14 sugar units, each terminated by a single mannose at the nonreducing end and by a methyl aglycon at the reducing end. Each isomer shows microheterogeneity, with 1 or 2 unmethylated mannose units near the middle of some but not all of the chains.", "pmid": "856790", "mesh_set": "D002850 D002854 D008759 D008766 D008968 D008970 D009161 D010169 D011135", "score": 18.370924, "rank": 2893, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The isozymic forms, separable by isoelectric focusing, have different contents of sialic acid. The utilization of L-glutamine (which is both a gamma-glutamyl donor and acceptor) is stimulated about 3-fold by maleate in contrast to 10-fold stimulation of glutamine utilization by the rat kidney enzyme. The gamma-glutamyl analogs, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) and L-azaserine inactivate the human kidney enzyme with respect to its transpeptidase and hydrolase activities. Inactivation is prevented by gamma-glutamyl substrates (but not by acceptor substrates) and is accelerated by maleate. [14C]DON reacts covalently and stoichiometrically at the gamma-glutamyl site, which was localized to the light subunit of the enzyme. The light subunit of human transpeptidase closely resembles that of rat kidney enzyme in having the gamma-glutamyl binding site, and similar molecular weight and amino acid composition.

The activation process involved CO2 rather than HCO3-. The activity of the enzyme was dependent upon the preincubation concentrations of CO2 and Mg2+ and upon the preincubation pH, indicating that activation involved the reversible formation of an equilibrium complex of enzyme-CO2-Mg. The initial rate of activation was linearly dependent upon the CO2 concentration but independent of the Mg2+ concentration. Kinetic analyses indicated that the enzyme reacted first with CO2 in a rate-determining and reversible step, followed by a rapid reaction with Mg2+ to form an active ternary complex (see eq 1 in text). The pseudo-first order rate constant, kobsd, for the activation process at constant pH was derived: kobsd=k1[CO2] + (k2k4/k3[Mg2+]). Experimentally, kobsd was shown to be linearly dependent upon the CO2 concentration and inversely dependent upon the Mg2+ concentration. The activity of the enzyme after preincubation to equilibrium at constant concentrations of CO2 and Mg2+ increased as the preincubation pH was raised, indicating that CO2 reacted with an enzyme group whose pK was distinctly alkaline.

The reverse was true when centrifugation was done at 1 C. Phospholipase D hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine molecules present in the supersubstrate at temperatures around 0 C at a rate 1/5 that of a maximal value measured at 30 C.

Influence of pH on kinetics of electron transfer.", "abstract": "pH Dependences of steady-state kinetic parameters of cytochrome chains of submitochondrial particles have been studies. It has been shown that the lifetimes of activated states (tau) of the pairs of cytochromes b leads to c1 and a leads to a3 have different pH dependences; those for the c1 leads to c and c leads to a cytochrome pairs being similar. The rate constants for the non-activated state of the respiratory chains decreased for the b leads to c1 pair and increased for the a leads to a3 pair when the pH value was increased. The values of pK calculated from these dependences for the pairs b leads to c1 and a leads to a3 were 7.2 and 8.9, respectively. It has been supposed that the ratio of activated to non-activated electron carriers may be controlled by the local pH value in the mitochondrial membrane, the latter being dependent upon the rate of electron transfer. The kinetic model based on this assumption allows one to explain the experimental dependences on pH of the rate constants for cytochromes b leads to c, and a leads to a3.

{"title": "The role of microsomal cytochrome b5 in the metabolism of ethanol, drugs and the desaturation of fatty acids.", "abstract": "Liver endoplasmic membrane contains two hemoproteins, cyt. P-450 and cyt. b5. Cytochrome P-450 catalyzes the hydroxylation of lipid-soluble compounds, while the cyt. b5 system is involved in desaturation of fatty acids. NAD(P)H and oxygen are essential components for both systems. Oxidation of ethanol to acetate in the liver, via alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases, leads to an elevated cellular NADH content. It has been proposed that oxidation of the cytosolic NADH occurs predominantly in the mitochondria via the substrate oxidation-reduction shuttle. In order to investigate the effects of elevated levels of cytosolic NADH on the state of the endoplasmic hemoprotein system, microsomes from a fatty human liver (post-ethanol intake) were isolated and studied. Microsomal cyt. b5 reductase was found to reoxidize cytoplasmic NADH directly and transfer the reducing equivalents readily to the microsomal oxidases. Addition of catalytic amounts of alcohol dehydrogenase, NAD, and ethanol to microsomes resulted in a rapid reduction of microsomal cyt. b5. These results are consistent with the proposal that the catalytic moiety of cyt. b5 reductase is exposed to the aqueous phase of the membrane and directly accepts reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm. Microsomes from fatty human liver showed an increased rate of cyt. b5 dependent desaturation of fatty acids. These findings suggest that ethanol metabolism may selectively affect the activity of one or the other microsomal hemoprotein. Thus, when the desaturase activity is low, drug metabolism by the cyt. P-450 pathway may predominate. Conversely, an increase in the desaturase level may lead to a decreased drug metabolism. This mechanism may underlie the clinical observations of drug intolerance reactions associated with alcohol intake.", "pmid": "12714", "mesh_set": "D000595 D001711 D003577 D003579 D003580 D004721 D000431 D005227 D005234 D006801 D008099 D008862 D008968 D009243 D009249 D010084", "score": 11.840446, "rank": 5801, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The appearance and exponential increase of intracellular virus preceded the release of extracellular virus by approximately 2 h. Demonstration of comparable titers of extracellular and intracellular virus at the end of the replication cycle indicated that a substantial amount of virus remained associated with cells exhibiting cytopathogenic changes. Mean buoyant density values of virus in sucrose ranged from 1.275 to 1.278 g/cm3, but in CsCl the virus banded at densities at 1.325 to 1.340 and 1.261 to 1.281 g/cm3. Although virus infectivity was not affected by high concentrations of CsCl, it was found by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the salt removed several nonglycosylated polypeptides with estimated molecular weights of 15,000 to 60,000. This suggested that the high-density band (1.325 to 1.340) may reflect the loss of these structural components. The half-life of virus infectivity was approximately 26.5 h at 26 degrees C and 11.2 h at 37 degrees C.

{"title": "Plasma sodium concentration and sodium excretion in the anaesthetized dog.", "abstract": "1. The effect of acute alterations of plasma sodium concentration (PNa) on renal sodium excretion (UNaV) was investigated by three types of experiments on anaesthetized dogs: (a) A local increase in PNa at one kidney was produced by infusion of hypertonic saline directly into its artery while systemic levels of PNa were stabilized by haemodialysis. (b) Systemic levels of PNa were lowered by exchange transfusion of blood for an equal volume of salt-free dextran-in-dextrose solution. The results were contrasted with those observed after similar exchanges, but using dextran-in-saline solution. (c) The level of PNa was altered by varying the sodium concentration of a saline solution infused at a fixed rate either intravenously or into one renal artery. 2. All three types of experiment suggest a dependence of UNaV on PNa Analysis demonstrated that this relationship was not due to contemporary changes in: packed cell volume; plasma solids concentration; plasma potassium concentration; blood pressure or plasma hydrogen ion concentration. The distribution of these variables did not change with PNa except for plasma hydrogen ion concentration. Moreover, the relationship persisted when data were selected to exclude clearance periods in which the value for any variable had shifted past the group mean obtained before PNa was altered. 3. The fall in UNaV at low levels of PNa could be attributed to a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but the progressive rise in UNaV seen as PNa exceeded 150 m-mole 1(-1) occurred despite a fall in GFR and no apparent change in the mean filtered load of sodium.

In WD animals the difference in hydrogen ion concentration between venous and arterial blood increased because the [H+] increased more in venous than in arterial blood. In WSD animals (A-V) [H+] remained unchanged since both [H+]a and [H+]v increases were parallel. [H+] variations seem to represent the changes in fixed-acid concentration of blood. The difference between both groups of animals in (A-V) [H+] changes could be ascribed to PCO2 variations. [HCO-3] values changed inconsistently. Arterial samples from the experimental groups showed a continuous decrease at the same rate of change. The mean values in WSD were lower than in WD. [HCO-3]v of WSD decreased slowly during the experiment. The rate of decrease of (A-V) [HCO-3] was higher in WD than in WSD. The different behavior of of [HCO-3] between both arterial and mixed venous samples and among experimental groups disappeared if [HCO-3] changes were corrected for bicarbonate generation due to PCO2 variation (respiratory bicarbonate). Thus [HCO-3] corrected for PCO2 variation represents metabolic changes, in good agreement with both [H+] and BE variations. The metabolic acidosis cannot be explained only on the basis of the increase in blood lactate; it is suggested that other fixed acids might contribute to the decrease in blood bicarbonate. In both experimental groups PvCO2 increased continuously. The (A-V) PCO2 showed the same rate of change. There is a good relationship between this increase and the degree of plasma volume change. It therefore might be that PvCO2 increase is a direct consequence of hemodynamic impairment. In WD and WSD, BE decreased progressively in both arterial and mixed venous samples. BEa values were lower than BEv values after the experiment began. (A-V) BE decreased in an exponential manner in both experimental groups; this change could be ascribed to the increased level of deoxygenated hemoglobin in mixed venous blood, thus giving rise to a decrease in fixed acid concentration.", "pmid": "11442", "mesh_set": "D000136 D000471 D000818 D001639 D001769 D002245 D003681 D004039 D004285 D006863 D010313", "score": 13.414421, "rank": 5298, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Influence of adipose tissue blood flow on the lipolytic response to circulating noradrenaline at normal and reduced pH.", "abstract": "Hypercapnic acidosis (pH 7.0) inhibits the lipolytic response of canine subcutaneous adipose tissue to i.v. infused noradrenaline (NA) by 80 per cent or more. The response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, on the other hand, is only reduced by 10-40 per cent during acidosis. The fate of intravenously infused 3H-labelled NA (0.35 ug X kg-1 X min-1 for 30 min) was not significantly altered by acidosis. The rate of disappearance of unmetabolized NA from the arterial plasma after an infusion was the same at pH 7.4 and 7.0 and the calculated increase in circulating NA during infusions was 4 ng/ml at both pH:s. I.v. infusion of Na increases adipose tissue blood flow, an effect which is attenuated by acidosis. There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between adipose tissue blood flow and the lipolytic response at normal pH. Preventing the NA-induced increase in blood flow by constant flow perfusion reduced the lipolytic response at normal pH. The degree of inhibition by acidosis of the lipolytic response to i.v. NA was significantly reduced (from 79 to 56 per cent, p less than 0.05) when the adipose tissue was perfused at constant flow. These data suggest that adipose tissue blood flow is important in determining the lipolytic response to i.v. NA, probably by influencing the delivery of NA to the tissue. The marked inhibition by acidosis of lipolysis due to i.v. infused NA therefore appears to be the combined effect of a direct antilipolytic effect of acidosis and a decreased delivery of NA to the adipose tissue due to the attenuated blood flow response.", "pmid": "9778", "mesh_set": "D000273 D000818 D001786 D001794 D004285 D005230 D005260 D005990 D006863 D007275 D050356 D009638 D012039 D014655", "score": 16.149002, "rank": 4017, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Efflux obeys first-order kinetics, and the stimulation of efflux by exchangeable ions such as acetoacetate and lactate obeys Michaelis--Menten kinetics. The apparent Km value +/- S.E. for acetoacetate was 0.56 +/- 0.14 mM (n = 5) and that for lactate 12.3 +/- 2.3 mM (n = 6). The Vmax. values +/- S.E. at 0 degrees C were 16.2 +/- 2.0 and 21.9 +/- 2.7 nmol/min per mg of protein. The exchange of a variety of other substituted monocarboxylates was also studied. Efflux was also stimulated by increasing the external pH. The data gave a pK for the transport process of 8.35 and a Vmax. of 3.31 +/- 0.14 nmol/min per mg. The similarity of the Vmax. values for various exchangeable ions but the difference of this from the Vmax. in the absence of exchangeable ions may indicate that transport of pyruvate occurs with H+ and not in exchange for an OH- ion. The inhibition of transport by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate took several seconds to reach completion at 0 degrees C. It is proposed that inhibition occurs by binding to the substrate site and subsequent reaction with an -SH group on the inside of the membrane. The inhibitor can be displaced by substrates that can also enter the mitochondria independently of the carrier and so compete with the inhibitor for the substrate-binding site on the inside of the membrane. A mechanism for transport is proposed that invokes a transition state of pyruvate involving addition of an -SH group to the 2-carbon of pyruvate. Evidence is presented that suggests that ketone bodies may cross the mitochondrial membrane either on the carrier or by free diffusion. The physiological involvement of the carrier in ketone-body metabolism is discussed.

A23187 also induces an antimycin A-insensitive burst in oxygen utilization which is partially blocked by 5 mM aspirin or 10 muM indomethacin. Under our conditions, A23187 (up to 10 muM) does not appear to damage platelet membranes since it does not cause appreciable loss of lactate dehydrogenase or beta-glucuronidase.

The synthesis of prostaglandins E(2), D(2), and F(2alpha) by rat renal medulla mince is stimulated by 1 and 5 muM A23187 without changes in tissue ATP content, lactate output, or K(+) efflux. X537A, monensin A, and nigericin (all 5 muM) stimulate both prostaglandin output and K(+) efflux from renal medulla, while 5 muM valinomycin or A204 has no effect on either. None of the ionophores stimulates renomedullary prostaglandin production if calcium is omitted from the incubation medium. A23187 also stimulates prostaglandin production by human lymphoma cells, rat stomach and trachea preparations, and guinea pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Several hepatic and adipose tissue lipogenic enzymes (fatty acid synthetase, citrate cleavage enzyme, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase) were assayed. These lipogenic enzymes exhibited high activities in liver and relatively low concentration in adipose tissue of the fish. The activities of all the hepatic lipogenic enzymes assayed, except for NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, were depressed as the level of lipid in the diet was increased; however, the activities of these enzymes in mesenteric adipose tissue were not influenced by the diets fed.

In contrast, dexamethasone did not alter the rate of aminotransferase elongation even though it elevated enzyme activity between 5- and 10-fold.

Spermidine is shown to be degraded to putrescine and 3-aminopropionaldehyde, and spermine to be cleaved to spermidine and 3-aminopropionaldehyde. A single enzyme catalyzing both reactions and designated as polyamine oxidase has been purified 4000-fold to electrophoretic homogeneity. Polyamine oxidase appears to be a flavoprotein, containing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a prosthetic group. Hydrogen peroxide is evolved in the reaction and no other electron acceptors except molecular oxygen have been found. The molecular weight of the enzyme was approximately 60 000 and the sedimentation coefficient 4.5 S. The enzyme appears to be a single polypeptide chain since no evidence for structural subunits was obtained. Polyamine oxidase was sensitive to sulfhydryl and carbonyl group reagents. The optimum pH value for the oxidation of polyamines was close to 10. The reaction velocities were enhanced by various aldehydes, especially certain aromatic aldehydes. Polyamine oxidase appears to be localized in peroxisomes of liver cells, although the existence of an isoenzyme in the cytosolic fraction was not definitively ruled out. No marked changes were observed in the activity of polyamine oxidase in rat liver after partial hepatectomy, carbon tetrachloride poisoning, and after treatment with growth hormone or thioacetamide, conditions which are known to alter profoundly the metabolism and accumulation of polyamines.", "pmid": "12798", "mesh_set": "D000818 D006863 D007700 D008099 D008970 D010088 D011073 D051381 D013095 D013096 D013347", "score": 14.892575, "rank": 4662, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Potential mechanisms responsible for the reduction of efferent sympathetic activity were examined in the present series. Guanabenz failed to modify carotid sinus nerve activity in a perfused sinus preparation. It reduced sympathetic outflow, heart rate and blood pressure in debuffered cats indicating that its actions are not mediated primarily by baroreceptor mechanisms. alpha-Adrenergic blockade greatly attenuated the response suggesting that the central sympathoinhibitory effect of guanabenz results from alpha-adrenergic receptor activation. Only a high dose of the compound attenuated the increase in sympathetic nerve activity produced by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus.

The animals were killed at definite time intervals between 12 h and 21 days after freezing. Twelve hours after freezing, the necrosis of the brain cortex is complete. It extends wedgeshaped into the subcortical white matter. The central parts of the necrosis become colliquative and are demarcted by leucocytes. Two days after freezing, the necrotic area is almost totally invaded by leucocytes. Three days p.op. the brain wound is infiltrated by microglial cells, later on the mesenchymal cell proliferation extends to the meninges. There is new capillary formation and partially a wall like proliferation of the perivascular connective tissue cells. Ten days and later, an uni- or multiloculated pseudocyst develops, which can be considered as the final stage of the reparative wound healing of the cryonecrosis. Similar as in the other investigated organs (liver, kidneys, spleen) these investigations underline the rapid wound healing of the cryonecrosis in the brain. The advantages of cryosurgical manipulations with the well known good wound healing process of other organs, justifies therefore the short term tissue freezing on the cerebrum.", "pmid": "848277", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001921 D005260 D005615 D009336 D051381 D013997 D014945", "score": 22.89855, "rank": 1409, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "positive/labeled"}

In a NaCl and KCl medium, the light-dependent decrease in the Mg2+ content of the thylakoid membranes at pH 8.0 is found to be 23 nmol Mg2+ per mg chlorophyll, whereas in a sorbitol medium it is 83 nmol Mg2+ per mg chlorophyll. (2) A light dependent increase in the Mg2+ content of the stroma was detected wjem chloroplasts were subjected to osmotic shock, amounting to 26 nmol/mg chlorophyll. Furthermore, a rapid and reversible light-dependent efflux of Mg2+ has been observed in intact chloroplasts when the divalent cation ionophore A 23 187 was added, indicating a light-dependent transfer of about 60 nmol of Mg2+ per mg chlorophyll from the thylakoid membranes to the stroma. (3) CO2 fixation, but not phosphoglycerate reduction, could be completely inhibited when A 23 187 was added to intact chloroplasts in the absence of external Mg2+. If Mg2+ was then added to the medium, CO2 fixation was restored. Half of the maximal restoration was achieved with about 0.2 mM Mg2+, which is calculated to reflect a Mg2+ concentration in the stroma of 1.2 mM. The further addition of Ca2+ strongly inhibits CO2 fixation. (4) The results suggest that illumination of intact chloroplasts causes an increase in the Mg2+ concentration of 1-3 mM in the stroma.

The steady-state kinetics of the interconversion of CO2 and HCO3 catalyzed by human carbonic anhydrase C was studied using 1H2O and 2H2O as solvents. The pH-independent parts of the parameters k(cat) and Km are 3-4 times larger in 1H2O than in 2H2O for both directions of the reaction, while the ratios k(cat)/Km show much smaller isotope effects. With either CO2 or HCO3 as substrate the major pH dependence is observed in k(cat), while Km appears independent of pH. The pKa value characterizing the pH-rate profiles is approximately 0.5 unit larger in 2H2O than in 1H2O. 2. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate catalyzed by human carbonic anhudrase C is approximately 35% faster in 2H2O than in 1H2O. In both solvents the pKa values of the pH-rate profiles are similar to those observed for the CO2-HCO3 interconversion. 3. It is tentatively proposed that the rate-limiting step at saturating concentrations of CO2 or HCO3 is an intramolecular proton transfer between two ionizing groups in the active site.

Fasting plasma glucose, OGTT-glucose, and IRI areas were significantly decreased in both groups of patients, though the effects on glucose metabolism were much more marked in diabetics; 30-min IRI relative increase was unchanged; fasting plasma IRI was reduced in diabetics only. Glucose utilization during insulin tolerance tests carried out in 6 diabetics was significantly enhanced after treatment. Serum triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol (Chol) were significantly decreased in both groups of patients, as were serum free fatty acids and uric acid in diabetics; plasma GH and cortisol did not change. Significant correlations were found in diabetics between the postclofibrate decrease in OGTT-glucose area and the following: pretreatment values of serum Chol (r + 0.42, p less than 0.05) and of 30-min IRI absolute and relative increase (r + 0.44 and + 0.38, respectively, p less than 0.05); postclofibrate decreases in serum TG (r + 0.40, p less than 0.05), in fasting plasma glucose (r + 0.73, p less than 0.001), and in OGTT-IRI area (r + 0.57, p less than 0.01).

Confirmation of myocardial ischemia was provided by electrocardiographic and biochemical indexes. Prostaglandin F2alpha release into coronary venous blood was significantly elevated during myocardial ischemia, whereas indomethacin treatment prevented this increase in coronary venous prostaglandin F2alpha concentrations. No significant increase in prostaglandin E2 release was observed in response to myocardial ischemia, but indomethacin treatment significantly reduced coronary venous prostaglandin E2 concentrations below those of control values. Within one hour after occlusion of the coronary artery, the S-T segment was significantly altered, and coronary venous prostaglandin F2alpha had increased significantly above the control concentration. These changes persisted during four hours of myocardial ischemia. Plasma creatine phosphokinase activity increased significantly after two hours of myocardial ischemia and remained elevated for the subsequent two hours of ischemia. After four hours of myocardial ischemia, myocardial creatine phosphokinase activity of ischemic myocardium was significantly reduced, and labilization of myocardial treatment prevented increases in prostaglandin release but did not influence other biochemical changes or the electrocardiographic response to ischemia.

Non-collagenous substances in newborn calf dermis were extracted with solutions of various concentrations of MgCl2. The total protein and hydroxyproline contents in MgCl2 extracts increased with increase in the concentration of MgCl2 in the solutions. In particular, steep increases of their contents were observed at concentrations of MgCl2 from 0.5 to 1.0 M. Total amounts of hydroxyproline in 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 M MgCl2 extracts were equivalent to 40-50% of the hydroxyproline content in the whole connective tissue. Hexose and hexosamine contents of MgCl2 extracts increased with increase of the MgCl2 concentration. Hexuronic acid was hardly present in the residues after extractions with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 M MgCl2. 2. Plasma proteins, hyaluronic acid, and dermatan sulfate were extracted at low concentrations of MgCl2. A non-collagenous protein and MgCl2-soluble collagen were extracted with 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 M MgCl2 solutions. The disperson of collagen fibrils was observed in the residue extracted with 1.0 M MgCl2 solution by electron microscopy; the fibril structure of collagen was disordered by extraction with 2.0 and 3.0 M MgCl2. The results suggest that the dispersion and disorder of collagen fibrils lead to the release of a non-collagenous protein. Furthermore, it is suggested that the removal of hyaluronic acid and dermatan sulfate was not very effective for the solubilization of a large amount of collagen, but was suitable as a pretreatment to the extraction of a non-collagenous protein accompanied by the solubilization of a large amount of collagen. 3. The non-collagenous protein was purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this protein at pH 8.5 showed a single band moving to the cathode.

This conversion to adipocytes is accelerated by addition of insulin to the culture medium [Green, H. & Kehinde, O. (1975) Cell 5, 19-27]. During the course of the insulin-mediated adipocyte conversion, the specific activity (units/mg of protein) of glutamine synthetase [L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.3.1.2] increases more than 100-fold. The specific activities of hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) and glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (D-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP(+) 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) also increase but less dramatically (1.5- to 3-fold). In contrast, confluent cells maintained in the absence of insulin for the same time (12-20 days after confluence) display only minimal increases in the activity of these enzymes. Maintenance of confluent cells in culture medium lacking added L-glutamine has little, if any, effect on glutamine synthetase activity in either control or insulin-treated cultures. Treatment of confluent 3T3-L1 cultures with hydrocortisone (1 mug/ml) for 3 days prior to harvesting results in an increase in glutamine synthetase specific activity of 12-fold for control cultures maintained for 13 days in the absence of insulin and 1.4-fold for adipocyte cultures maintained for 13 days in the presence of insulin (10 mug/ml). Treatment of 3T3-L1 control cells and adipocytes with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM) plus theophylline (1 mM) decreases the glutamine synthetase specific activity and almost completely reverses the insulin- and hydrocortisone-mediated increases in enzyme activity. In contrast, treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP plus theophylline has relatively little effect on the specific activities of hexokinase or glucose-6-P dehydrogenase or on the protein content of the cultures.

L-Dopa levels rose to 1.85 +/- 1.33 microgram/ml (mean +/- SD), but maximum plasma levels occurred at variable times from 30-230 min after drug administration. Plasma GH levels increased to 23.7 +/- 14.7 ng/ml, while PRL levels fell to 46.7 +/- 12.3% of the mean basal values. Rectal temperature decreased significantly in 3 of the men after L-dopa ingestion. Plasma GH levels after L-dopa correlated with the absorption of the drug (P less than 0.05) and inversely with the basal level of GH before L-dopa administration. There was no correlation between the basal PRL level or basal body temperature and the magnitude of the fall in PRL or body temperature after L-dopa administration. The variability of responses in GH, PRL, and body temperature after oral L-dopa ingestion is not the result of differences in  absorption in the amino acid alone, and indicate either that there is a different sensitivity in the mechanisms that stimulate GH secretion and lower plasma PRL and body temperature, or that L-dopa acts at different sites to bring about each of these changes.", "pmid": "263355", "mesh_set": "D000293 D000328 D001831 D013006 D006801 D007030 D007408 D007700 D007980 D008297 D011388 D012881", "score": 12.114777, "rank": 5735, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "Relation of protein synthesis and transglutaminase activity to formation of the cross-linked envelope during terminal differentiation of the cultured human epidermal keratinocyte.", "abstract": "When serially cultivated human epidermal keratinocytes are placed in suspension culture they stop growing and form, beneath the plasma membrane, an insoluble envelope consisting of protein cross-linked by epsilon- (gamma-glutamyl)lysine. The formation of envelopes in suspended cells is preceded by a sharp decline in the rate of protein synthesis, and most envelopes appear only after the average rate of protein synthesis has fallen to a very low level. If protein synthesis is reduced over 98 percent with cycloheximide or emetine at the time that surface-grown cells are placed in suspension culture, cross-linked envelopes form in most of the cells. This shows that the precursor of the envelope and the cross-linking enzyme are already in the cytoplasm in most cells of growing surface cultures. The process of envelope formation by suspension cultures is actually accelerated by the inhibitors of protein synthesis; an increased number of cells with cross-linked envelopes is observable within 4-6 h after the addition of cycloheximide. The inhibitor also induces a large fraction of the cells of surface cultures to form enveloped within a few days. These findings suggest that arrest of protein synthesis leads to activation of the cross-linking process. Agents known to inhibit transglutaminase-mediated protein cross-linking-putrescine, iodoacetamide, and ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (EGTA)- also prevent envelope formation.

In this paper, we report on a revised treatment regimen involving initiation of treatment (50 mg/kg/day) on day 7 after birth and continuing for 3 weeks. Animals treated by this protocol have a low mortality rate (approx. 10% above saline-treated controls) and no permanent growth deficit. Analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in and light microscopic examination of superior cervical ganglia of the guanethidine-treated animals indicate complete destruction of sympathetic neurons by the end of the second week of treatment. During and after treatment there are no decreases in norepinephrine in whole brain of the treated animals. Norepinephrine levels in peripheral tissues are markedly reduced at both 9 and 16 weeks of age. Stimulation of vasomotor outflow produces no increase in blood pressure in guanethidine-treated rats at 9 or 26 weeks of age, indicating a complete and permanent functional denervation of the vasculature.

Several patterns of response were given by the inhibitors.

Single doses of 700R, 500R, 300R, 200R and 100R total body gamma irradiation, administered 6-8 days after EAE induction, appeared to delay the onset, reduce the severity, and hasten recovery of the disease. The magnitude of this effect was approximately prportional to the administered radiation dose. A single 1000R x-irradiation dose, delivered to a 1 x 2cm area in the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord 7 or 10 days after induction appeared to increase the severity of EAE. Mannitol distribution spaces were mildly elevated in the thoracic regions and significantly elevated in the lumbar spinal cords of cord-irradiated animals. A marked exacerbation of the disease was observed in cord-irradiated rats treated with 5000R, administered over a period of 5 days. Rats progressively lost weight during the normal course of EAE, and a simultaneous increase in wet weights of the spinal cords was seen. Slight changes in these two parameters were observed in cord-irradiated, but not in total-body irradiated animals.", "pmid": "833617", "mesh_set": "D000818 D001812 D001835 D004307 D004681 D005260 D008353 D008722 D009929 D051381 D013116", "score": 15.858739, "rank": 4147, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The second was a pregnancy of 32 wk with retention for more than 8 wk; fibrinogenemia was between 170 mg/100 ml and 140 mg/100 ml. 2 intravascular coagulations with normal fibrinogenemia, increase of fibrin degradation products and positive ethanol tests. 3 cases with slight coagulation defects that were difficult to explain. The coagulation defects appeared to be transient, and sometimes resolved themselves spontaneously. Induction of labour was made in 19 cases; quinine sulfate, used in 17 cases, was remarkably successful (1 intolerance, 1 failure).

(1975) Can. J. Biochem. 53, 1089-1100). In studies done with tissue sections (6-10 micron), it is shown that alkaline phosphatase activity and labelling of active sites by orthophosphate are lost during incubation with ethanolamine at pH 9.0. Addition of Mg2+ causes total recovery of catalytic activity and active sites labelling. Zn2+ displaces and replaces at the Mg2+ binding sites. The affinity for both ions is similar, and dissociation of Zn2+ from the enzyme is a very slow process, even in the presence of Mg2+. The Zn2+-alkaline phosphatase and Mg2+-alkaline phosphatase, which only differ by the ion bound to an apparent modulator site, have the same catalytic activity at pH less than 7.0, but the Zn2+ species has little activity at alkaline pH. Phosphorylation of the enzyme by orthophosphate indicates that with both enzyme species phosphoryl intermediate does not accumulate at alkaline pH. These results suggest that with orthophosphate, the phosphorylation step is rate determining for both enzymes, and that Zn2+ affects this step to a much greater extent. It is proposed that Zn2+ and Mg2+ regulate alkaline phosphatase in rat placenta. The concentration of both ions in maternal serum and placenta suggest that such a mechanism could exist in vivo.", "pmid": "15714", "mesh_set": "D000469 D000818 D002462 D004789 D004983 D005260 D006863 D066298 D007700 D008274 D010920 D011247 D051381 D015032", "score": 18.705023, "rank": 2757, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

{"title": "[Fate of subsequent pregnancies in relation to the outcome of previous pregnancies].", "abstract": "Adverse outcome of the previous pregnancy as a risk factor for the next one has lately been given increased attention. Particular concern has been expressed as to the possible adverse effects of induced abortion on subsequent pregnancy outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The purpose of the present report was to establish on the basis of population studies whether and to what extent, abnormal outcome of pregnancy increases the risk of abnormal outcome of the next or further pregnancies. Particular attempt was made to evaluate the increased risk of abnormal outcome of pregnancy following spontaneous and induced abortion. A sample of the studied population was originally collected in several Departments of Obstetrics for a study on epidemiology of low birth weight, and its selection was conditioned by that study. The sample included women whose present pregnancy resulted in the delivery of a live born child. This pregnancy was not taken into consideration in the present study except as a basis for selection of 2 study groups of women who previously had at at least 2 pregnancies (except the present one): Group A consisted of 1180 women who gave birth in the recent pregnancy to a full term child weighing over 3000 g and Group B of 1170 women who delivered a low birth weight infant in their previous pregnancy. Mothers of infants weighing between 2500 and 3000 g were also included in this group because the foetal growth tables for Polish newborn infants showed that weight limits at the 5th percentile for full term male infant ranged between 2500-2800 g and below 10th percentile between 2600 and 3000 g. The following outcomes of previous pregnancies were considered: Full term newborn infant (FT) Low birth weight infant (less than or equal to 2500 g) (Pr) Spontaneous abortion (SA) Induced abortion (IA) Other outcomes (O) Contingency tables containing information on the frequency of different outcomes of earlier and later pregnancies were prepared and the effects of the mode of termination of the earlier pregnancy on the later ones were demonstrated. Interrupted pregnancies were not included in the whole number of cases for the calculation of the percent value, as the decision to interrupt is usually arbitrary and very seldom related to the outcome of the previous pregnancy. The differences between the distribution of pregnancy outcomes in various categories of termination of earlier pregnancy were tested by standard Chi square test which was useful also for testing the dependence of the mode of outcome of the preceding and the following pregnancy. The relative risk coefficient was also calculated for two different combinations of outcomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "pmid": "263523", "mesh_set": "D000028 D000022 D005260 D005313 D005317 D005500 D006801 D010298 D011247 D011248", "score": 8.732158, "rank": 6111, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Plants were established on amended soil (vermicompost:sawdust:soil 1:1:1) severely polluted by lead-acid batteries (LAB) located at Mexico State, Mexico. Plants inoculated with Acaulospora sp., Funneliformis mosseae and Gigaspora gigantea had 100% survival in comparison to non-inoculated plants (57%).

Spatial changes in Pb soil availability were observed at the end of this research. No fungal effect on P, Ca, Cu foliar concentrations, soluble sugars, proline, chlorophyll or on the activity of two oxidative stress enzymes was observed.

Insulin was deliberately withheld. Animals were examined by autopsy daily for 7 days post-alloxan and after 4 and 8 weeks. Mortality was high--only 52% of the males survived as against 80% of the females. Most deaths occurred on Day 5 and were associated with adrenal haemorrhage and hyperplasia, thymus galnd involution, fatty liver and marked hypotension despite elevated aldosterone levels. During the first week, corticosterone levels increased significantly in the male; in females they showed little change. After 4 weeks, the severly diabetic animals became emaciated and moribund; corticosterone and aldosterone levels fell to very low levels despite adrenal hyperplasia. The beta cells of the moderately diabetic animals eventually lost their ability to secrete insulin and these animals too became cachetic and moribund with concomitant elevation of lipid, glucose and BUN levels, as well as myocardial infarction, fatty liver, and generalized hyalin arteriolo-, arterio-, and nephrosclerosis. It is suggested that the combined hormonal and metabolic alterations of diabetes and hypertension reinforced one another in these spontaneously hypertensive rats, leading to intense stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system, the exacerbation of those cardiovascular degenerative changes known to be associated with uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, eventual impaired adrenocortical steroidogenesis, hypotension and death.", "pmid": "861167", "mesh_set": "D000450 D000818 D001835 D002318 D003345 D003921 D005260 D006973 D008297 D009929 D051381 D011919", "score": 17.12322, "rank": 3498, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Progesterone, on the other hand, had no significant effects. In the oestradiol treated rats, the portal vein basal insulin levels were slightly reduced. Oestradiol, however, had a marked suppressive effect on the alpha cells of the pancreas resulting in a greater reduction in basal glucagon and impaired glucagon response to alanine infusions. The relative insulin to glucagon (I/G) molar concentration ratio in portal vein blood was increased. Oestradiol also produced a dose dependent increase in the activity of the liver lipogenic enzymes, acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase. On the other hand, the activity of the gluconeogenic rate limiting enzyme phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was inhibited. The cross-over pattern of gluconeogenic intermediates confirmed inhibition of gluconeogenesis at this step, an effect which is similar to that induced by relative insulin 'excess'. Progesterone produced an increase in the portal vein insulin concentrations. Both the basal and the alanine-stimulated glucagon levels were also increased. The I/G molar ratio in portal vein blood of progesterone treated rats remained unaltered and the hepatic lipogenic and gluconeogenic enzyme activities were similar to control animals. These data suggest that insulin activity is increased relative to glucagon in the liver of oestradiol-treated rats due to the rise in portal vein I/G ratio. The changes in liver lipogenic and gluconeogenic enzymes and the alterations in fasting plasma triglycerides and glucose in response to oestrogens could be secondary to this effect.", "pmid": "19260", "mesh_set": "D000105 D000103 D000818 D001786 D002369 D004958 D064429 D005227 D005260 D005934 D005943 D007328 D050356 D008099 D010728 D010729 D011374 D051381 D014280", "score": 26.544792, "rank": 814, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

We wished to determine whether this effect of trypan blue could be due to a selective inhibition of certain macrophage functions or whether it reflected a broader form of immunosuppression. We therefore tested the effects of trypan blue on a variety of immunological responses. Treatment of mice with trypan blue delayed their rejection of skin allografts and transplants of a highly antigenic syngeneic ultraviolet light-induced tumor. Trypan blue treatment of either donor or recipient decreased the local graft-versus-host reaction. Filtration of lymph node cells from trypan blue-treated donors on a nylon wool column before use in the graft-versus-host assay abrogated the depressive effect of trypan blue. A transient reduction in the blastogenic response of spleen cells to concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide mitogens was observed after a single injection of trypan blue, but the response of lymph node cells was unaffected. The depressed response of splenic lymphocytes was not entirely reversed by removal of adherent cells. The primary and secondary hemagglutinin responses to sheep erythrocytes were unaffected in trypan blue-treated mice, and the proportion and phagocytic activity of thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages were also unaltered.

{"title": "[Uric acid as electronic acceptor of chicken liver's XDH (author's transl)].", "abstract": "Uric acid seems to act as an electronic acceptor in the dehydrogenation of hypoxanthine catalyzed by chicken liver's xanthinedehydrogenase (XDH). Oxidation was observed in crude homogenates under anaerobic conditions, although dialyzed homogenates or purified hepatic XDH also induce a similar action either in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The reaction pH optimum is about 6.0. Xanthine appears to be the only inhibited product of the reaction when its concentration is greater than 1 X 10(-4) M.

In order to protect the contact region of the proteins the complex of the two proteins was labeled. Advantage was taken of the fact that a group which is buried in the complex reacts about (see article) times slower than a group which is always exposed (K = dissociation equilibrium constant, [C] = concentration of the complex). The complex was dissociated at pH 3 and the labeled proteins were isolated by column chromatography. They were fully active. The dansyl label was immobilized when introduced by dansyl chloride but highly mobile when attached via the longer imidoester group (II). Changes of absorption and of fluorescence which occur when differently labeled reaction partners recombine were studied. Changes in absorption (up to 18%) were mainly due to interactions of the label of one protein with the other protein. Fluorescence changes of up to 480% could be obtained. They were interpreted in terms of a F\u00f6rster type energy transfer between donor and acceptor labels and changes of absorption and quantum yield due to interactions of the labels with the proteins. The kinetic constants of complex formation are not seriously altered by the labels (B\u00f6sterling, B & Engel, J. (1976) this J. 357, 1297-1307, succeeding).

Absorption from the stomach ligated at the pyloric end was 5-8 fold less than absorption of carbromal injected directly into the small intestine. Oral doses greater than 20 mg/kg of carbromal disappeared more slowly from the gastro-intestinal tract because gastric emptying was delayed. Both carbromal and bromoethylbutyramide were able to reduce the basal tone and the acetylcholine-induced contraction of isolated rat fundus strips. Carbromal and bromoethylbutyramide distributed evenly between serum, brain and skeletal muscle. Concentrations in adipose tissue were three times those in the other three tissues. Concentrations of both carbromal and of bromoethylbutyramide in all four tissues declined at the same rate. Thus, serum concentration of either compound may be used to estimate the total body content. Intraperitoneally injected carbromal, bromoethylbutyramide and ethylbutyrylurea disappeared from the brain and from the serum with half-life of 3-4 h and 5-7 h, respectively. Traces only of unchanged carbromal, bromoethylbutyramide, or ethylbutyrylurea were excreted with urine or feces indicating rapid and extensive biotransformation of the three compounds in this species.

{"title": "Activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase in muscle from vertebrates and invertebrates.", "abstract": "1. The activities of citrate synthase, NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase were measured in muscles from a large number of animals, in order to provide some indication of the importance of the citric acid cycle in these muscles. According to the differences in enzyme activities, the muscles can be divided into three classes. First, in a number of both vertebrate and invertebrate muscles, the activities of all three enzymes are very low. It is suggested that either the muscles use energy at a very low rate or they rely largely on anaerobic glycolysis for higher rates of energy formation. Second, most insect flight muscles contain high activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, but the activities of the NADP+-linked enzyme are very low. The high activities indicate the dependence of insect flight on energy generated via the citric acid cycle. The flight muscles of the beetles investigated contain high activities of both isocitrate dehydrogenases. Third, other muscles of both vertebrates and invertebrates contain high activities of citrate synthase and NADP+-liniked isocitrate dehydrogenase. Many, if not all, of these muscles are capable of sustained periods of mechanical activity (e.g. heart muscle, pectoral muscles of some birds). Consequently, to support this activity fuel must be supplied continually to the muscle via the circulatory system which, in most animals, also transports oxygen so that energy can be generated by complete oxidation of the fuel. It is suggested that the low activities of NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase in these muscles may be involved in oxidation of isocitrate in the cycle when the muscles are at rest. 2. A comparison of the maximal activities of the enzymes with the maximal flux through the cycle suggests that, in insect flight muscle, NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyses a non-equilibrium reaction and citrate synthease catalyses a near-equilibrium reaction. In other muscles, the enzyme-activity data suggest that both citrate synthase and the isocitrate dehydrogenase reactions are near-equilibrium.", "pmid": "8036", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002950 D007448 D007521 D007700 D051379 D009132 D009243 D009249 D007652 D011817 D051381 D014714", "score": 15.005526, "rank": 4599, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The cholesterolemia was about 100 mg/100 g in rats fed agar-agar, cellulose, bran or the stock diet. Pectin addition (5%) lowered significantly the plasma concentration of cholesterol (70 mg/100 g). Changes in the source of dietary fiber or salt mixture have moderate effects on the absorption coefficient of dietary cholesterol (range 58.2%-82%). In comparison to agar-agar, cellulose at 2.3% in the diet significantly lowered this coefficient, but larger amounts of cellulose (6.8% or 12.3%), or pectin (5%) were without effect, while bran addition (10%) tended to slightly decrease cholesterol absorption. Hence, high levels of cellulose in the diet increased the absorption coefficient in comparison to a low cellulose diet. A decrease of this coefficient was also observed when the calcium content of the diet was increased. Cholesterol biosynthesis and fecal excretion were inversely correlated to the absorption coefficient of dietary cholesterol in rats fed all of the semipurified diets indicating, as previously shown, that the intestine was the major source of biosynthesized cholesterol diverted into the plasma.

With this system, serum pH can be adjusted with CO2 gas and Ca2+ and pH simultaneously measured; when 5.2% CO2 (40 mm pco2) is used for sample equilibration, the standard bicarbonate concentration is also provided. I measured serum Ca2+ as a function of pH between pH 7.0 and 9.0 and found the relationship to be reproducible, with no evidence of irreversible complexing of Ca2+. When the pH of aerobically exposed, mailed sera was restored to the original values, their values for Ca2+ were the same as for the fresh sera. Measurement of Ca2+ in routinely (aerobically) handled sera after pH restoration with CO2 gas was therefore validated, both samples from within an institution and mailed specimens. Standardization to pH 7.40 is recommended for routine measurements, is generally more accurate than use of heparin or quasianaerobic techniques, and is a practical approach. In patients with possible uncompensated acid-base disturbance (which may be indicated by an abnormal standard bicarbonate concentration if not suspected clinically), patient pH should be measured independently as part of the usual strict, anaerobic blood-gas-analysis procedures. Abnormal patient pH must be considered in the interpretation of Ca2+ results determined at pH 7.40 which are borderline or slightly abnormal; most accurately, Ca2+ may be measured in the separated sera at the previously determined patient pH value. Studies of aqueous solutions with the currently used Ca2+ electrodes showed a selectivity coefficient (the constant which relates the activity of an interfering ion to the activity of calcium that would contribute the same emf) KNa=0.0031 +/- 0.0003 (SE) and KMg=0.046 +/- 0.004 (SE).

Although the enzyme has an absolute requirement for K+, the concentration required for maximum activation is dependent on the concentration of substrate. At saturating levels of AMP (greater than or equal 2.0 mM) maximum activation is observed with 25 mM KCl, whereas at lower substrate concentrations (0.2 mM) approximately 50 mM KCl is needed for maximum activation. Conversely, the response of enzyme activity ot increasing levels of substrate is dependent on the level of potassium ions. At substrating concentrations of K+, the saturation curve for AMP is highly sigmoidal (nh=3.2) whereas at higher KCl concentrations, the apparent cooperativity between AMP sites is almost completely abolished (nh=1.5). The inhibition by a number of phosphorylated metabolites, including ATP, GTP, creatine-P, and P1, is likewise sensitive to the concentration of K+. These results suggest that a significant amount of interaction between K+ sites and both substrate and effector sites is required for the expression of the catalytic and regulatory properties of the enzyme. The specific effects of ATP, creatine-P, and P1 on the parameters of Km and Vmax indicate that each of these profile of AMP deaminase activity generated in response to variations in the adenylate energy charge shows that within the physiological range of energy charge (0.75 to 0.95), the activity increases linearly with decreasesing energy charge and is insensitive to both the total adenylate pool size and the presence of P1 and creatine-P.

Determination by radioimmunoassay.", "abstract": "This study demonstrates that a serine endopeptidase of pancreatic origin (elastase 2) circulates in human blood. A specific and highly sensitive radioimmunoassay has been developed for pancreatic elastase 2 in human serum. The inactivation of elastase 2 employed as radioiodinated tracer with an active site-specific reagent (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) was necessary to prevent its binding by serum alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha2-macroglobulin while maintaining its immunoreactivity. The assay is based upon competition of standard human pancreatic elastase 2 with 125I-labeled phenylmethanesulfonyl elastase 2 for specific antibody binding sites, after which a second antibody precipitation step is used to separate bound from free 125I-labeled phenylmethanesulfonyl elastase 2. The minimum detectable concentration of elastase 2 was 0.9 ng/ml. The average normal fasting serum level determined was 71 ng/ml, approximately 80-fold greater than the minimum detectable amount. The form of radioimmunoassayable elastase 2 in normal human serum has been investigated by gel filtration of serum samples on Sephadex G-200 followed by radioimmunoassay of column fractions. The majority of the immunoreactive elastase 2 is eluted from G-200 in the void volume. While a minor amount of elastase 2 is eluted in a position consistent with alpha1-antitrypsin-elastase 2 complex, no free elastase or free proelastase is detectable. Addition of exogenous elastase 2 to normal serum prior to gel filtration on G-200 produced an increase only in the peak of radioimmunoassayable elastase bound to alpha1-antitrypsin. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that while elastase 2 bound to alpha1-antitrypsin is immunologically reactive, alpha2-macroglobulin-bound elastase 2 cross-reacts less than 2% in this radioimmunoassay. The assay has been shown to be specific for elastase 2. Human pancreatic elastase 1, anionic trypsin, chymotrypsin I, and chymotrypsin II do not cross-react in this assay system.

The kinetics of labelling of unesterified linoleate was consistent with the view that this labelled fatty acid was derived from 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine. 3.

A 3-fold increase in alpha-GPD observed 24 h after the iv injection of 3 microngT3/100 g BW was completely inhibited by administration of alpha-amanitin at 0 and 8 h. Similarly, alpha-amanitin blocked a two- to four-fold increase in malic enzyme 24 h following iv injection of 3 mg T3/100 g BW into euthyroid rats. After the initial inhibition of enzyme induction by alpha-amanitin was dissipated, however, a delayed but striking increase in enzyme activity occurred. In hypothyroid animals, alpha-GPD activity rose after the initial 24 h inhibition and reached levels at 72 h equal to those observed in hypothyroid rats treated with T3 only. In euthyroid animals treated with T3 and alpha-amanitin, a delayed increase in malic enzyme activity was observed at 72 h and attained values at 96 h similar to those in euthyroid animals injected with T3 only.

In horizontal and bipolar cells, blocking chemical transmission caused membrane potential changes of the same polarity as the responses to illumination in each cell type. 2. Acceleration of transmitter release from the receptor terminals depolarized the horizontal cells, which is the opposite polarity to the light response. 3. Stimulation by transretinal current flowing from receptor side to vitreous side depolarized the receptor terminals and triggered transmitter release, which in turn evoked transient postsynaptic potentials in horizontal and bipolar cells. The polarity of the postsynaptic responses was the opposite to that of the light-evoked responses in each type of cell. 4. Hyperpolarization of the receptor terminals by the current of relatively long duration flowing from vitreous side to receptor side reduced the transmitter release, as demonstrated by the horizontal cell hyperpolarization. 5. From these observations, it is inferred that the receptors release the transmitter in the dark and that the transmission depolarizes horizontal and off-center bipolar cells by increasing membrane permeability chiefly to Na+ and hyperpolarizes the on-center bipolar cell by decreasing membrane permeability to Na+.", "pmid": "7385", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002118 D002347 D003035 D004558 D005071 D007811 D008274 D008564 D018377 D010775 D010786 D011188 D012160 D012964 D013569 D009435", "score": 15.441232, "rank": 4359, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

Denervated preparations were contracted by drugs that had a direct effect on smooth muscle cells, such as acetylcholine and histamine, but not by stimuli acting on cholinergic neurons, such as electrical field stimulation or nicotine. After blockade of beta-adrenoceptors, norepinephrine relaxed the innervated guinea pig ileum contracted by electrical field stimulation, by stimulating alpha-adrenoceptors. Norepinephrine in low concentrations did not relax denervated preparations contracted by agents acting directly on smooth muscle. In high concentrations, it relaxed denervated preparations by a nonadrenergic mechanism, resistant to alpha- and/or beta-receptor blockade, but which was also activated by 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) ethanol. Phenylephrine only had a weak agonistic effect on the electrically stimulated innervated preparation and did not relax the denervated one. The denervated rabbit intestine contracted by acetylcholine was relaxed by norepinephrine and phenylephrine by stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors. In the innervated preparations both drugs were more effective in inhibiting contractions induced by electrical field stimulation or eserine than those induced by exogenous acetylcholine. Both the denervated guinea pig and rabbit intestine were relaxed by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. It is suggested that in the guinea pig ileum alpha-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation are located only in cholinergic neurons, whereas in rabbit jejunum they are located both in these neurons and in the smooth muscle cells.

In K+- and Na+-free choline chloride media, Li+ is transported into the erythrocytes against an electrochemical gradient. This Li+ uphill transport as well as Li+ downhill transport into the cells is inhibited by ouabain, ATP-depletion, and by external K+ and Na+. The effects of K+ and Na+ are relieved at high Li+ concentrations. 2. Ouabain-sensitive Li+ uptake, determined at 10 mM external Na+, does not obey simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and exhibits a maximum at about pH 7. 3. Ouabain-resistant Li+ downhill transport into erythrocytes increases with rising pH. It is comprised of a saturating component and a component linearly dependent on external Li+. The linear component is partly inhibited by dipyridamole and accelerated by bicarbonate. The bicarbonate effect can be completely blocked by dipyridamole, phlorizin and phenylbutazone. 4. Li+ release is not inhibited by ouabain, ATP-depletion and external K+. It increases with external Na+ concentration, tending to saturate at 150 mM Na+. Na+-independent Li+ release is stimulated by bicarbonate. It is concluded that ouabain-sensitive Li+ uptake is mediated at the K+-site(s) of the Na+-K+ pump. Li+, K+ and Na+ appear to compete for a common site (or sites). The stimulation of Li+ transfer by bicarbonate and the inhibition by dipyridamole suggest a participation of anionic species in ouabain-resistant Li+ transfer.

No ultrastructural alterations were seen after 1 h ischaemia, but reversible disappearance of muscle glycogen and swelling of muscle and nerve mitochondria occurred after 2 h ischaemia. Irreversible alterations such as disappearance of the Z-line, disruption of cell membrane and vacuolation of muscle mitochondria were observed after ischaemia of 3 h and longer in a part of the muscle fibres. Ischaemia for 6 h was followed by autolysis of all the muscle fibres within the specimens. Autolysis and phagocytosis of the remnants of the affected fibres was present on the 4th day. On that day regenerative phenomena were also observed, such as satellite cells and young myotubes. The fine structure of the muscle fibres was normal on the 18th day after the temporary ishcaemia, although some size variation of the muscle fibres was still observed. Degeneration of a part of the presynaptic nerve endings of motor end-plates with or without simultaneous degeneration of the postsynaptic muscle fibre was seen after ischaemia lasting 3 h or longer.

{"title": "Effects of protein deficiency on the biosynthesis and degradation of ribosomal RNA in rat liver.", "abstract": "Employing livers from rats fed on a protein-free diet for two weeks, the effects of protein deficiency on both biosynthesis and degradation of rRNA were investigated and the following results were obtained. 1. Protein deficiency led to a decrease of total liver RNA content per DNA to about 80% of that in normal rat liver. 2. From the kinetics of rRNA labelling with [14C]orotic acid in vivo, the half-lives of cytoplasmic rRNA's of normal and protein-deficient rat livers were determined to be 6.2 and 5.1 days, respectively. Furthermore, considering the pool size of rRNA in rat liver, the turnover rate of cytoplasmic rRNA was calculated to be 0.212 pmole/min/mg of nuclear DNA in normal rats and 0.240 pmole/min/mg of nuclear DNA in protein-deficient rats. 3. From the electrophoretic patterns of nucleolar RNA's of both groups of rat livers labeled with [14C]orotic acid, the time courses of the specific activities of nucleolar 45S, 32S, and 28S rRNA's were analysed and the half-life of each nucleolar RNA in both groups of rat livers was determined. Nucleolar 45S, 32S, and 28S RNA's had half-lives of 6.0, 15.9, and 26.5 min in normal rats, respectively, and 5.5, 19.4, and 22.9 min in protein-deficient rats, respectively Considering the pool size of each nucleolar RNA obtained from the leectrophoretic pattern, the turnover rates of 45S, 32S, and 28S RNA's were calculated to be the same, i.e., o.189 pmoles/min/mg of nuclear DNA, in normal rat liver and 0.372, 0.372, and 0.358 pmoles/min/mg of nuclear DNA in protein-deficient rat liver, respectively. 4. These results indicate that protein deficiency increased both the rate of degradation of cytoplasmic rRNA and that of nucleolar rRNA synthesis in rat liver. While in normal rat liver the rates of rRNA synthesis and degradation were rather similar, the rate of rRNA synthesis in protein-deficient rats was about 1.5 times higher than that of its degradation. Therefore, the decrease of total liver RNA content in protein deficiency might be accounted for by stimulated degradation of rRNA in the nucleus. 5. The activities of RNase in nuclear fractions of both groups of rat livers were compared. Both activities of nuclear acid RNase and especially that of the free form of alkaline RNase in protein-deficient rat liver were higher than those in normal rat liver.", "pmid": "845133", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002466 D003593 D004247 D004044 D005260 D008099 D008970 D009963 D011488 D012335 D051381 D012260", "score": 20.021627, "rank": 2235, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

High mortality and insufficient progeny in the groups given 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg made it impossible to continue those two regimens into the second generation. The study was continued for 20-23 wk with F1A generation animals given 1.5 mg/kg and controls. The only lesion found at necropsy that could be attributed to patulin administration was gaseous distention of the gastrointestinal tract, which was probably the result of the antibiotic effect of this mycotoxin on the normal intestinal flora. A decreased weight gain in male rats of the FO generation was dose-related. An impairment in growth rates of F1A and F2A progeny of both sexes was statistically significant at the 1.5 mg/kg dose level. Fetuses taken from patulin-treated females on day 20 of pregnancy were noticeably smaller than controls fetuses and the difference was significant for F2A males. No other teratological abnormalities related to patulin dosing at the 1.5 mg/kg level were observed consistently in either F1A or F2A fetuses.

Shunt activity was measured by the ratio of radiolabeled carbon 1 (14C-1) of glucose to radiolabeled carbon 6 (14C-6) of glucose derived as expired 14CO2. Diamide and NEM were both found to increase pentose shunt activity relative to glycolysis, although by different means. Diamide appeared to exert its effect by oxidizing glutathione and creating a demand for higher shunt activity to facilitate glutathione reduction by NADPH. Both C-1 and C-6 oxidation were increased, but C-1 oxidation was increased to a much greater extent. In contrast, NEM decreased both C-1 and C-6 oxidation, with C-6 preferentially affected. Thus NEM appears to preferentially inhibit the enzymatic machinery of the glycolytic-tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway and acts as an effective metabolic stress on the cornea.

The development of plaque index values was observed simultaneously. These observations were carried out during a 1-year clinical trial, the effects of sucrose (S) and xylitol (X) chewing gum on the incidence of dental caries being observed in 100 young adults. Paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were diluted stepwise and cultivated on Rogosa S.L. agar and Sabouraud agar aerobically. Lyophilized dental plaque samples were cultivated on phenol red agar under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The pH-values were measured after incubating the mixed plaque flora for 1 and 7 days in the presence of various sugars. Both the arithmetic and geometric means of the total CFU values on Rogosa S.L. agar decreased in the S-group at the 6-month phase but returned to the starting level after one year, whereas in the X-group they decreased or remained on the starting level. At the 6-month phase the difference between the groups was significant (U-test, p = 0.0013) and almost significant (U-test, p = 0.0569) at the end of the study. No significant differences or changes could be seen between or within the groups on Sabouraud agar. The geometric mean values of S. sanguis and S. mutans as well as the total CFU values on phenol red agar decreased considerably in both the S- and X-groups, but no significant differences could be detected in any of the streptococcal counts between the groups. The pH of the carbohydrate-containing culture media infected with mixed dental plaque significantly decreased, with the exception of the xylitol containing ones in which the pH values were not lowered even after 7 days' incubation. A significant decrease in plaque formation in relation of chewing per se was demonstrable.

In contrast to results with enzyme from E. coli strain B (Miller, R. E., and Stadtman, E. R. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 7407-7419), this enzyme catalyzes NH3-dependent glutamate synthase activity. Selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent activity was obtained by treatment with the glutamine analog. L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (chloroketone). Inactivation by chloroketone exhibited saturation kinetics; glutamine reduced the rate of inactivation and exhibited competitive kinetics. Iodoacetamide, other alpha-halocarbonyl compounds, and sulfhydryl reagents gave similar selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent activity. Saturation kinetics were not obtained for inactivation by iodoacetamide but protection by glutamine exhibited competitive kinetics. The stoichiometry for alkylation by chloroketone and iodoacetamide was approximately 1 residue per protomer of molecular weight approximately 188,000. The single residue alkylated with iodo [1-14C]acetamide was identified as cysteine by isolation of S-carboxymethylcysteine. This active site cysteine is in the large subunit of molecular weight approximately 153,000. The active site cysteine was sensitive to oxidation by H2O2 generated by autooxidation of reduced flavin and resulted in selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent enzyme activity. Similar to other glutamine amidotransferases, glutamate synthase exhibits glutaminase activity. Glutaminase activity is dependent upon the functional integrity of the active site cysteine but is not wholly dependent upon the flavin and non-heme iron. Collectively, these results demonstrate that glutamate synthase is similar to other glutamine amidotransferases with respect to distinct sites for glutamine and NH3 utilization and in the obligatory function of an active site cysteine residue for glutamine utilization.", "pmid": "6449", "mesh_set": "D001665 D004926 D005970 D005973 D005779 D007460 D007659 D007700 D009249 D011485 D000637", "score": 15.360941, "rank": 4405, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The action of insulin on the transport and the distribution of Na and K has been studied in rat soleus muscles incubated at 30 degrees C in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. 2. Measurements of the uptake and the wash-out of 22Na indicate that the muscles contain an intracellular pool of Na available for transport which is confined to the water space not available to sucrose. Ouabain (10(-4)-10(-3)M) inhibited 22Na efflux by 69% (0-287 micronmole/g tissue wet weight per minute) and 42K-influx by 40% (0-196 micronmole/g tissue wet weight per minute). When all extracellular Na was replaced by Li, both 22Na-efflux adn 42K-influx were inhibited to about the same extent and ouabain produced very little further inhibition. 2,4-dinitrophenol decreased the ouabain-resistant component of 22Na-efflux by 39%. 3. Insulin (from 0-1 to 100 mu./ml.) increased the rate coefficient of 22Na-efflux by from 11 to 46% within 15 min. In the presence of ouabain (10(-3)M), the same relative increase was obtained, indicating that the hormone stimulates the glycoside-sensitive and the glycoside-insensitive Na transport to a similar extent. The effect of insulin on 22Na-efflux was not abolished by tetracaine (0-5 X 10(-3)M), phlorizin (0-5 X 10(-2)M) or by the substitution of Na, K, Mg or Ca. In the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol (0-5 X 10(-4)M) or at temperatures below 15 degrees C, the hormone produced no detectable change in 22Na-efflux. 4. Insulin increased 42K-influx from 0-525 to 0-664 mumole/g tissue wet weight per minute. This effect was entirely blocked by ouabain but not by tetracaine. Insulin produced a 14% transient decrease in 42K-efflux. 5. The continued exposure to insulin led to a new steady state, in which the intracellular Na pool was decreased from around 10 to around 5 mumole/g tissue wet weight and the K content increased by an equivalent amount. In the presence of ouabain or at low extracellular concentrations of K, insulin increased the rate of 22Na-influx by around 35%. This effect was blocked by 2,4-dinitrophenol but not be tetracaine. 6.

After a 24-h digestion at 36 degrees with the lysosomal extract at a pH of 5.5 or lower (collagen/lysosomal protein; 2/1 or 8/1), both native and denatured collagen were degraded to an extent equivalent to 60 to 70% of that observed upon total acid hydrolysis in 6 N HCl as measured by the ninhydrin reaction (570 nm). At a pH of 6.0, native collagen and denatured collagen were degraded by the mixture of lysosomal proteinases to 11% and 40% of total acid hydrolysis, respectively. At pH 6.5 AND 7.0, the corresponding values were 3% versus 33% and 0.3% versus 11%, respectively. Fragments of collagen (TCA and TCB) are produced when mammalian collagenase degrades native collagen at 25 degrees.

The experiments at pH 6.5 and 7.0 were done using a collagen/lysosomal protein ratio of 2/1. At pH 5.0 (a pH which is found within secondary lysosomes), the lysosomal extracts degraded collagen to a mixture of free amino acids and small peptides.

However, the anticancer effects and the underlying mechanisms of RB on pancreatic cancer remain elusive. Here, we found that RB inhibited the viability and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells Panc-1 and Aspc. Resibufogenin-induced apoptosis was through inhibition of constitutive nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity and its target genes' expression, which was caused by downregulation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) levels and suppression of I\u03baB kinase activity in Panc-1 and Aspc cells. This induction of TAK1-mediated NF-\u03baB inactivation by RB was associated with increased glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylation and subsequent suppression of its activity. Moreover, RB-induced GSK-3 phosphorylation/inactivation acted through activation of protein kinase C but not Akt. Finally, RB suppressed human pancreatic tumor xenograft growth in athymic nude mice. Thus, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which RB suppresses TAK1-mediated NF-\u03baB activity through protein kinase C-dependent inhibition of GSK-3.

The highest increases were observed in DU patients after the oral as well as after the intraduodenal test meal. After the intraduodenal test meal in 4 normal subjects and in 17 DU patients an increase of gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin was measured. In basal state, after an intraduodenal or an oral test meal, DU patients with normal gastric acid secretory capacity had higher serum gastrin concentrations than DU patients with gastric hypersecretion. There was a good correlation between peak serum gastrin levels after the oral and after the intraduodenal test meal. From these data it is concluded: (1) Intraduodenal application of a test meal results in release of gastrin from extragastric sites. (2) Extragastric gastrin is biologically active. (3) DU patients are able to release more antral and more extragastric gastrin in response to a test meal.

{"title": "Nerve growth factor action on membrane permeation to exogenous substrates in dorsal root ganglionic dissociates from the chick embryo.", "abstract": "An experimental system has been described, in previous studies, where the ability of chick embryo dorsal root ganglionic cells to incorporate radiouridine into RNA declines in the absence of nerve growth factor (NGF), and is promptly restored by delayed supply of the factor. Following these early and fully reversible events, further NGF deprivation causes progressive irreversible damage. The early decline in RNA labeling and its reversion by NGF are accompanied by similar changes in the accumulation of acid-soluble radioactivity from the exogenous radiouridine substrate. In the present study, it is shown that the NGF-dependent accumulation of \"soluble\" radiomaterials is independent from, and responsible for, the NGF-dependent alterations in RNA labeling. Both changes are measurable with labeled cytidine and guanosine, as well as uridine, and in all cases accumulation of acid-precipitable and acid-soluble radioactivities are strictly proportional to each other. The acid-soluble responses to NGF are not prevented by actinomycin D or cycloheximide treatments, demonstrating that they require neither ongoing syntheses of RNA or protein nor prior effects of NGF on them. Chromatography of acid-soluble radiopools showed that the NGF-dependent increase was not due to a distortion in the intracellular phosphorylation of uridine; but involved corresponding increases in all the radiouridine derivatives including UTP. The time patterns of the acid-soluble response were comparable to those of the RNA labeling response, and maximal NGF effects occurred within minutes of its presentation. Finally, 2-deoxyglucose and a-aminoisobutyric acid, but not leucine, showed NGF-dependent accumulation patterns similar to those of the 3 nucleosides. It is proposed that regulation of selected membrane permeation properties could be the primary process through which NGF exerts its trophic role.", "pmid": "843936", "mesh_set": "D000241 D000621 D000818 D002463 D002642 D003513 D003562 D003609 D003847 D005727 D006151 D009414 D009474 D012313 D013997 D014529", "score": 11.450149, "rank": 5874, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The most active guanosine 5'-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl pyrophosphate):glycopeptide mannopyranosyltransferase (GPD-D-mannose mannosyltransferase) was found in two unresolved membrane fractions ( p congruent to 1.1 g/cm3). This preparation incorporated [14C]mannose from GDP-D-[14C]mannose both into endogenous acceptors and added peptidophosphogalactomannan. Mannosyltransferase activity is optimum at pH 7.0 in 0.05 M Tris/maleate buffer, and 17 mM Mn2+. Replacement of Mn2+ with Fe2+, Mg2, Co2+, Ca2+ or Ni2+ greatly reduced the mannosyltransferase activity. [14C]Mannose incorporation from GDP-D-[14C]mannose into acceptors is linearly dependent on enzyme concentration. Mannosyl incorporation into peptidophosphogalactomannan is linear for 3 h and continues for at least an additional 4 h. In contrast, the rate of mannosyl incorporation into endogenous acceptor(s) decreases after 60 min and there is no incorporation after 2 h. A series of possible acceptors related to peptidophosphogalactomannan were tested and it was found that treatment of peptidophosphogalactomannan with 0.01 N HCl at 100 degrees did not appreciably decrease the effectiveness of the acceptor even though this treatment removes the galactofuranosyl residues. In contrast, treatment of peptidophosphogalactomannan with 0.5 N NaOH rendered the products nearly incapable of accepting mannosyl residues from GDP-D-mannose. Derivation of peptidophosphogalactomannan with 2,4-dinitrobenzene also decreased its effectiveness as a mannosyl acceptor. [14C]Mannose from GDP-D-[14C]mannose was incorporated into both the oligosaccharide and phosphogalactomannan regions of peptidophosphogalactomannan. Treatment of the [14C]peptidophosphogalactomannan product, with 0.4 N NaOH released [14C]mannosyl-containing residues which eluted in the mannobiose and polysaccharide fractions from BIo-Gel P2. Approximately 90% of the 14C was in mannobiose. The [14C]mannose was shown to be transferred to the mannosyl-(seryl/threonyl) region of the acceptor.

In two subjects given equivalent doses (100 mg/kg intravenously) of carbenicillin and aqueous penicillin G, the bactericidal activity of serum against B. fragilis after administration of each drug was the same. Controlled clinical trials of treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections with penicillin G in high dosage, carbenicillin (or closely related ticarcillin), clindamycin, and chloramphenicol should be undertaken.

In 38 infants delivered at term, acid-base balances and O2 and CO2 pressures were obtained in umbilical arterial and venous blood at birth, prior to the first inspiration. For the purpose of the study the infants were divided into two groups: group I infants were born after a normal labor in which the amniotic membranes were permitted to rupture spontaneously at full cervical dilatation; group II infants were born after a labor in which the membranes were ruptured artificially when cervical dilatation was 4 to 5 cm. There was no evidence of fetal distress, and all infants were vigorous at birth. The pH of umbilical venous blood was greater in the group with late rupture of the membranes (fiftieth percentile [P50] = 7.36) than in those born after early amniotomy (P50 = 7.30) (p less than 0.01). The pH values of umbilical arterial blood were also higher in the group I infants (P50 = 7.31) than in those born after amniotomy (P50 = 7.25)(p less than 0.025). These differences were also observed in the 19 neonates in whom the cord was not encircled around the neck at the time of birth. The PCO2 in umbilical venous blood was less, and the hemoglobin saturation was greater (P less than 0.05) in group I infants than in those of group II.

After 1 month of treatment with 5 MRC units/kg/day, there was little effect on these parameters. On the other hand, the hormone appears to have an effect on the remodelling sequence, as indicated by a large and very significant decrease in the extent of resorption lacunae unoccupied by osteoclasts. It is suggested that the duration of the reversal phase, separating the end of active resorption from the beginning of active bone formation in each remodelling focus, is greatly decreased. This shortening is associated with a prolongation of the bone formation phase, and the extent of osteoid tissue is markedly and proportionally increased in the treated animals. After a prolonged administration, calcitonin does not seem to impede the formation of new osteoclasts, their number being only slightly diminished, but it remains possible that it does continue to inactivate these cells.

Assay conditions required the use of an ATP-regenerating system consisting of creatine kinase, creatine phosphate, and myokinase for the preservation of ATP levels. LH-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) in rabbit CL showed the following properties: 1) The pH optimum of basal activity was about 8.0; that of LH-stimulated activity was about 7.5. 2) The relative response to LH was low (1.5 to 2-fold) at 0.1 mM ATP and increased with increasing ATP, but not with increasing GTP. At low (0.1 mM) ATP, GTP increased catalytic efficacy of the system, both in the absence and in the presence of LH (no effect on relative stimulation). 3) The optimal relative stimulation by LH was obtained at about 1.0 mM MgCl2 in excess of added magnesium-binding ingredients. 4) The sensitivity to stimulation by LH (about 0.2 mug/ml NIH-LH-B8) was unaffected by either pH, nucleotides (ATP and GTP), or MgCl2 concentration. 5) Under the assay conditions used, activity was stimulated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) about 1.5 to 2-fold, and by epinephrine about 3 to 4-fold. In all aspects tested, LH-stimulated AC in rat CL resembled that in rabbit CL, except that about 5-fold higher concentrations of NIH-LH-B8 were needed for half-maximal stimulation. The AC activity in pig Graafian follicles, however, differed from that in rabbit CL in that 1) the ATP concentration needed for optimal stimulation by LH was lower (in the micromolar rather than the millimolar range); 2) catecholamines elicited only a 1.3 to 1.4-fold stimulation; and 3) NIH-LH-B8 elicited half-maximal stimulation at 0.008 to 0.020 mug/ml.

{"title": "The influence of physicochemical factors on the thermal inactivation of murine interferon.", "abstract": "The degradation of biological activity of virus-induced murine interferon was determined in linear nonisothermal and multiple isothermal tests. The stabilizing effect of pH during heating on interferon in solution was greatest at low pH, such that pH 2 greater than pH 5 greater than pH 7 greater than or equal to pH 9; freeze-dried preparations of interferon were also more heat-stable at acid pH than at neutral pH. Heat stability was a function of the H+-ion concentration rather than the ionic composition of the buffer; interferon solutions containing monovalent cations with different ionic radii had similar heat stability. A change in the H+ ion concentration was a critical event during the cooling of heated interferon: a shift in the direction of acidity contributed to stability whereas a shift towards alkalinity led to inactivation. The rate of cooling of heated interferon significantly influenced its residual activity. Rapid cooling and sudden freezing decreased the residual activities of interferons at pH 2 and 9 more than \"normal\" cooling, an effect not observed at pH 7. Interferon heated to 80degree C could not be reactivated at 40degree C or 55degree C. Interferon of higher apparent molecular weight was more heat-stable than that with lower apparent molecular weight.

A 1 mus luminescence component probably originating from System II was found of which the relative amplitude was maximum under anaerobic conditions for reaction centers in the state SPQ- before the flash, about one third for centers in the state S+PQ- or SPQ before the flash, and about one tenth for centers in the state S+PQ before the flash. S is the secondary donor complex with zero change; S+ is the secondary donor complex with 1 to 3 positive charges; P, the primary donor, is the photoactive chlorophyll a, P-680, of reaction center 2; Q- is the reduced acceptor of System II, Q. Under aerobic conditions, where an endogenous quencher presumably was active, the luminescence was reduced by a factor two. The 1 mus decay of the luminescence is probably caused by the disappearance of P+ formed in the laser flash according to the reaction ZP+ leads to Z+ in which Z is the molecule which donates an electron to P+ and which is part of S. After addition of hydroxylamine, the 1 mus luminescence component changed with the incubation time exponentially (tau = 27 s) into a 30 mus component; during the same time, the variable fluorescence yield, measured 9 mus after the laser flash, decreased by a factor 2 with the same time constant. Hereafter in a second much slower phase the fluorescence yield decreased as an exponential function of the incubation time to about the dark value; meanwhile the 30 mus luminescence increased about 50% with the same time constant (tau = 7 min). Heat treatment abolished both luminescence components. The 1 mus luminescence component saturated at about the same energy as the System II fluorescence yield 60 mus after the laser flash and as the slower luminescence components. From the observation that the amplutide is maximum if the laser flash is given when the fluorescence yield is high after prolonged anaerobic conditions (state SQ-), we conclude that the 1 mus luminescence is probably caused by the reaction PWQ- + hv leads to P*WQ- leads to P+W-Q- leads to P*WQ- leads to PWQ- + hv in which W is an acceptor different from Q. The presence of S+ reduced the luminescence amplitude to about one third.

The time spent licking the bottles during water omission and the time spent drinking during a subsequent 5-min drinking session (water available) were recorded.

Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, and meprobamate (i.p., 30 min before water omission), increased the time spent licking the empty bottles, but failed to abolish subsequently enhanced drinking. However, some of our data suggested that minor tranquilizers weakly reduced the increased drinking induced by nonreward, despite their direct stimulation on water drinking.

Cardiac output and its complete distribution were measured by the radioactive microsphere (15 micrometer diam) technique. Although 5-HT did not change the systemic variables, methysergide caused a moderate increase in systolic and mean blood pressure and heart rate. 5-HT caused a substantial increase in gastric and a moderate increase in cerebral and myocardial blood flow at the expense of that to the lungs (arteriovenous shunt + bronchial flows), kidneys and skin. While methysergide was able to reduce the vascular responses to 5-HT in stomach, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs and brain, the drug itself, like 5-HT, decreased the number of microspheres reaching the lungs. Since a large number of 15 micron microspheres can escape through the arteriovenous anastomoses to lodge in the lungs it seems likely that both 5-HT and methysergide can reduce the 'non-nutrient' flow through these anastomoses.", "pmid": "28399", "mesh_set": "D000818 D002302 D004347 D006439 D008784 D011817 D012039 D012701", "score": 26.387074, "rank": 836, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

A Na+/NH4+ exchange at basal and/or lateral membranes of the transporting cells is suggested. 3. Low-sodium Ringer perfusate augmented Na+ influx; in one group of gills the transport rate was more than double that of NaCl Ringer controls.

Fractions containing >90 percent morphologically identifiable Muller cells were prepared by this procedure. Fractions containing only Muller cells were obtained by drawing selected cells individually into a micropipette under visual observation. Biochemical analyses of isolated Muller cells showed that (a) these cells did not synthesize and accumulate acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, or catecholamines when incubated with appropriate radioactive precursors; (b) the specific activities of choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6), glutamate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15), and tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2) in these cells were less than 2 percent of those found in the retina; (c) Muller cells, however, contained high activities of transmitter degrading enzymes-acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) and gamma-aminobutyrate- transamine (EC 2.6.1.19); and (d) the cells also possessed high levels of two presumably glial-specific-enzymes-glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) and carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1).

The high oxygen affinity of fetal blood in rabbits is due to a very low concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in the red cells. In order to gather informations on the factors responsible for this characteristic we have studied synthesis and break-down of 2,3-DPG in fetal and adult rabbit red cells in vitro and examined possible regulative pathways which may lead to the low 2,3-DPG concentration in vivo. 2. Under conditions where 2,3-DPG and 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) accumulate in adult erythrocytes, i.e. in a solution containing inosine, pyruvate and inorganic phosphate, the amount of 2,3-DPG synthetized in fetal red cells was only 40% of the adult value and 3-PGA was not measurable. Upon inhibition of enolase by NaF, however, both 2,3-DPG and 3-PGA increased to a similar extent in fetal and adult red cells. These findings point towards differences in the pyruvate kinase (PK) reaction which is one of the rate limiting steps of glycolysis. Direct measurements revealed an over tenfold higher PK activity in fetal compared to adult red cells. This higher activity of PK will lead to a decreased concentration of 3-PGA with a consecutive fall in 2,3-DPG concentration. 3. Other factors, like a decreased glucose utilization, a decreased activity of 2,3-DPG mutase or an increased 2,3-DPG phosphatase activity could be excluded as a cause for the low 2,3-DPG concentration in fetal red blood cells. The same holds for extraerythrocytic factors like glucose concentration or pH value in fetal blood. 4. During the postnatal development of rabbits the PK activity decreased. 50 days after birth, PK activity was 20% of the fetal value but still somewhat higher than in adult erythrocytes. This change is paralleled by an increase in 2,3-DPG concentration and half saturation oxygen pressure.

Following nitrogen inhalation there was an increase in [K]e which exhibited a sigmoid pattern in every age group: Firstly, there was a slow rate of rise which was followed by a sudden, steep increase where the [K]e rose to about 70 mM. During the subsequent 5-10 min a plateau value of about 90 mM was reached. The prominent difference between the age groups was the time until the steep rise began. The time to the steep increase in [K]e and the [K]e at the start of the steep was inversely related to the age of the animal. A close relation was found between the time to the start of the steep increase and the time to the last gasp during nitrogen breathing (r = 0.98). It is suggested that the different resistence to anoxia in young and adult animals is related to differences in the ability to keep near normal potassium gradients across the cells in the brain.", "pmid": "855671", "mesh_set": "D000367 D000818 D002540 D005110 D002534 D002546 D008839 D011188 D051381 D013997", "score": 26.070877, "rank": 879, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

This response is not increased after an alpha-agonist. However, ADP and ATP are themselves able to enhance the response to beta-agonists. 6 These interactions between alpha-agonists, beta-agonists and adenine nucleotides seem to involve steps subsequent to receptor activation.

When hexamethonium was applied exclusively to the distending part, significant increase of ACh release was observed in both the regions oral to and anal to the distended part. It is suggested that distension stimuli applied to the myenteric plexus are transmitted aborally along the network of the Auerbach's plexus to the anal direction.

{"title": "Control of energy production in cardiac muscle: effects of ischemia in acidosis.", "abstract": "Evidence is summarized indicating that mitochondrial respiration and citric acid cycle activity in the intact heart are controlled by the cytosolic phosphate potential and mitochondrial NAD oxidation-reduction state. Data are presented showing that the effect of respiratory acidosis is greater than that of metabolic acidosis in inhibiting left ventricular pressure development in the perfused rat heart, because of a greater fall of intracellular pH under the former conditions. Respiratory acidosis is shown to be readily associated with tissue hypoxia as a result of an increased vascular resistance and diminished flow rate through the coronary circulation. In nonischemic respiratory acidosis, the rate of ATP production is well balanced by the rate of ATP utilization, and tissue ATP and creatine-P levels remain approximately normal. Partially ischemic respiratory acidosis was associated with low tissue levels of ATP and creatine-P and high tissue levels of lactate and NADH. Ischemic areas with sharp border zones were visualized during and after an abrupt decrease of perfusion fluid pH by directly photographing NADH fluorescence from the surface of perfused hearts. Reversal of the hypodynamic state with partially ischemic respiratory acidosis could not be achieved by augmenting the coronary flow by means of an external pump. The demonstration of the existence of sharp zones of high pyridine nucleotide fluorescence adjacent to normal zones indicates a great heterogeneity of coronary perfusion and the existence of steep oxygen gradients in the intact heart.", "pmid": "22905", "mesh_set": "D000138 D000142 D000818 D001794 D002245 D003327 D004734 D006321 D006863 D066298 D008929 D009200 D009206 D009243 D010084 D010477 D051381", "score": 15.490944, "rank": 4335, "label_L100": "negative/unlabeled", "label_true": "negative/unlabeled"}

The following results were obtained. 1. The uptake of bromosulfophthalein follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics only at low substrate concentrations with an apparent Km=7 +/- 2 muM and V=2.6 +/- 1.7 nmol X mg protein -1 X min -1. At higher bromosulfophthalein concentrations a second mechanism of uptake is observed as indicated by the deviation from linearity in the Lineweaver-Burk plot. 2. The activation energy of uptake was found to be 11 kcal/mol at 10 muM bromosulfophtalein. 3. Uptake is independent of metabolic energy and of the Na+ gradient across the membrane. 4. Taurocholate does not inhibit uptake while indocyanine green inhibits competitively at low bromosulfophthalein concentrations and activates uptake at high bromosulfophthalein concentrations (greater than 20 muM). 5. Amino acid reagents, such as dinitrofluorobenzene, mersalyl, N-ethylmaleimide, and dithionitrobenzene, which modify specific functional groups, did not affect uptake at a concentration of 100 muM.  6. No pH optimum for bromosulfophthalein uptake was observed  in the physiological pH range.  7.

Adsorption is inhibited by indocyanine green. The results do not indicate the mediation of bromosulfophthalein uptake by a carrier protein and are consistent with the hypothesis that bromosulfophthalein is bound in an energy-consuming process to a translocating site, possibly in the undissociated form or as ion pair.

Before and during treatment, levels of HVA, MOPEG, and 5-HIAA, the major metabolites of DA, NE, and 5-HT, were determined in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid by a mass fragmentographic technique. Both treatments resulted in an elevation of the HVA levels after 2 weeks, thiothixene having a more marked effect. The effect of thiothixene but not of melperone persisted after 4 weeks. Thiothixene did not influence the MOPEG level, but melperone reduced it after 4 weeks of treatment. The 5-HIAA levels were not significantly altered by the drugs. The HVA/MOPEG and the HVA/5-HIAA ratios were highly significantly elevated by both drugs after 2 as well as 4 weeks. Thiothixene induced a significantly greater change of these ratios than melperone. The results supply evidence that thiothixene accelerates central dopamine metabolism in man, presumably by blocking DA receptors. Melperone appears to act similarly, but has an effect which is weaker and/or of shorter duration. During long-term treatment with melperone the receptors develop tolerance to it. The acceleration in DA metabolism declines and the effect of melperone switches instead to central NA metabolism. The results indicate that both drugs cause long-term changes in the activity ratios of central monoamine systems. It is suggested that such changes in several systems rather than single biochemical events may be related to the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptic drugs.

The following causes of failure to come into oestrus were diagnosed: suboestrus (76 per cent), genuine anoestrus (9 per cent), ovarian cysts (2 per cent), pyometra (6 per cent) and gestation (1 per cent). All these changes obviously had an effect on the fertility of the herds (Table 1). Genuine anoestrus was found to occur particularly in primparous cows, whereas ovarian cysts and pyometra were diagnosed in the older cows (Table 2). It also became apparent that suboestrus and genuine anoestrus mainly are problems in tying stalls during the winter season (Table 3).
